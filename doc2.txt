From reversible logistics	 we came to green logistics	 which is a wider concept of environmentally friendly thinking. Reverse logistics includes processes of movements and transportation of waste from users to recycling plants; meanwhile	 green logistics deals also with environmental issues such as pollution and environmental degradation caused by improper logistics processes and utilisation of old and environmentally unfriendly transport technology. The case of Southeast Europe was analysed	 and in this context	 a development model for green logistics implementation was proposed. A vast number of different challenges in the logistics sector are still open in this region; therefore	 systematic analyses and proposals should be subject of additional scientific work in the logistics sector. All parties	 including manufacturing industry	 logistics providers and governments should take an active part in such researches	 as the pressure from green thinking will become even stronger in the coming period.							
AB This article describes the trend towards European green initiatives in the transport sector. The introduction of green logistics management and green policy in Europe has been analysed to understand better the positive impact of green policy on environment	 society and economy. With the most recent EU initiatives in the field of green logistics	 intermodality has become the platform for green logistics development in the EU. This stimulated a complete study of the case of South East Europe. The perspective of intermodal infrastructure development	 the use of intermodality and the environmental impact of the transport sector has been analysed to build an appropriate model for a macro green logistics strategy for South East Europe	 where Green transport corridors should be exposed as the main goal. In our proposal of a seven-pillar strategy	 all parties	 including governmental institutions	 manufacturing industry and logistics operators	 should take an active part	 enabling industry to co-create a macro transport development in the region and to influence future legislation of green issues in the transport sector	 with an aim to establish Green transport corridors till 2020. There is a strong need to regulate green logistics issues in the region of South East Europe; therefore	 additional studies and proposals will be necessary in the future.					
AB This study investigates the role of absorptive capacity in implementing green logistics practices and the impact of the implementation on green logistics performance (GLP). Data were collected from a survey of 279 Australian Logistics and Transport operators and analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings indicate that enhancing green logistics knowledge exploitation is important to improve GLP. This can be achieved through changing the logistics operations and incorporating new knowledge into green practices in a way that can reduce CO2 emission	 fuel consumption	 or the cost of environmental compliance. The findings also show that addressing environmental concerns requires a process in which environmental information	 through a wide range of channels and practices	 is acquired	 assimilated	 transformed	 and exploited. The paper reports an original research that contributes to the understanding of the value of green practices and routines to the environmental performance of firms in the Logistics and Transport sector. The results provide practitioners with insights that facilitate the transformation towards greener logistics practices and routines.									
AB Sustainability is a subject of growing interest in business and environmental management. Many previous studies have emphasized the trade-off between economic activities such as manufacturing and its effect on the environment. Moreover	 previous studies have mainly focused on manufacturing enterprises; however	 no study has yet to cover the logistics sector. This study fills these gaps by testing the causal relationship between proactive green management and the sustainable performance of logistics enterprise in China. In addition	 when compared with previous literature that discusses the partial relationship between environmental variables and firm performance	 this study synthesizes the factors of green awareness and green strategy that may influence green logistics management in a total systematic structural equation model (SEM). SEM has an advantage in examining the causal relationship between green logistics practice and its business performance. The result shows that green logistics practice has a positive impact on sustainable business performance. This impact is composed of both a positive financial and environmental performance	 while the relationship between green awareness and business performance and the influence of green strategy on business performance is not significant.											
AB The purpose of this paper is to introduce the area of Green Logistics and to describe some of the problems that arise in this subject which can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems. The paper particularly considers the topics of reverse logistics	 waste management and vehicle routing and scheduling.

AB This article aims to analyze the factors influencing the adoption of green practices in Chinese logistics industry. The determinant factors are composed of technological	 organizational	 and environmental dimensions. A questionnaire survey on the green practice adoption of Chinese logistics companies was conducted	 and 322 samples were analyzed. Research results reveal that relative advantage and compatibility of green practices	 organizational support	 quality of human resources	 regulatory pressure	 and governmental support have significantly positive influences on the adoption of green practices for Chinese logistics companies. Environmental uncertainty and green practice's complexity have significantly negative influences on green practice adoption. However	 the influence of customer pressure is not significant for Chinese logistics companies. This article also suggests implications and opportunities for future research.								
AB THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOGISTICS OF THE SYNTHETIC PATHWAY IN GREEN CHEMISTRY. The role of the logistics in the design of synthetic pathways aimed at greenish is discussed. The influence on costs (of reagents	 solvents and total)	 as well as on atomic productivity green metrics (atomic economy and E factor)	 of the position along the pathway of a step with low yield	 or involving high dilution of the reagents or expensive reagents	 has been evaluated by calculations on a linear pathway model. The results show the economic importance of Green Chemistry and provide useful information for pathway design or improvement.											
AB Environmental challenges are in their course to be addressed by the main actors of economic life: businesses. At this level they take various forms and are managed using different approaches. One key area of translating environmental protection in action is logistics and the concept of green logistics covers all the changes needed in order to be compliant with environmental restrains. Our paper makes an extensive analysis of the contradicting requirements of green logistics in terms of costs	 time	 reliability	 warehousing	 and information technology. Meanwhile it is discussed the possibility to share costs and how all these take a form of action in a case study.												
AB This paper presents an optimization-based model to deal with integrated logistics operational problems of green-supply chain management (G-SCM). In the proposed methodology	 a linear multi-objective programming model is formulated that systematically optimizes the operations of both integrated logistics and corresponding used-product reverse logistics in a given green-supply chain. Factors such as the used-product return ratio and corresponding subsidies from governmental organizations for reverse logistics are considered in the model formulation. Results of numerical studies indicate that using the proposed model	 the chain-based aggregate net profits can be improved by 21.1%	 compared to the existing operational performance in the particular case studied. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasing pressures and stringent environmental regulations and increased public awareness against environmental impacts in developing countries have caused companies to try increasing environmental sustainability activities and forced them to choose suitable suppliers to reduce environmental risks in supply chain management. Many management practices that contribute to improving a firm's environmental performance are developed in the area of logistics. According to high impacts of logistics management	 the aim of this paper is using the fuzzy DEMATEL method to examine the influential logistical criteria of green supply chains	 because the nature of supplier selection in green supply chains is a complex multi-criteria problem. Logistics factors in GSCM are categorized in 5 main criteria as: procurement logistics	 production logistics	 distribution logistics	 disposal logistics	 and reverse logistics.										
AB Reverse logistics and green product design are green supply chain management practices that are being implemented to demonstrate firm's commitment to environmental sustainability. The generation of waste from electrical and electronic equipments prompts the viability of product recovery to salvage invested material and energy. Selection of various reverse logistics product disposition options relies on products' residual value and the accessibility of reusable content for re-entry in forward supply chain. This study explores the effect of green product design and resource commitment on reverse logistics product disposition by employing empirical analysis on 89 returned mail survey received from ISO14001 certified electrical and electronic manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The results indicated that design for disassembly is necessary to harvest valuable inventories from every product disposition options except of disposal whereas design for environment and commitment of resources have slight influence on repair and disposal activities. As the evidences show that green product design and reverse logistics product disposition are interrelated	 firms ought to undertake environmentally proactive approaches to generate benefits from resources that are undeservingly discarded as landfill waste.

AB Green supply chain issues have attracted a lot of attention in recent years with growing awareness of environmental concerns. This has drawn the considerable world-wide attention of academics and practitioners. Therefore	 recycling has now become an integral component of the supply chain. Recycling of used products and the related logistics management pose a significant challenge to manufacturing industries. In order to resolve the complexity of the task	 this study proposes a multi-agent architecture to handle recycling and reverse logistics issues	 which have so far been neglected. It addresses the different aspects of recycling such as waste classification	 recycling	 logistics and reuse of products. Additionally	 it also discusses how the agent communicates and acts autonomously to facilitate the efficient logistics of materials between different units. The proposed agent architecture can assist manufacturing industries in efficiently managing their green supply chain system and complex logistics issues.										
AB Green Logistics has emerged as the new agenda item in supply chain management. The traditional objective of distribution management has been upgraded to minimizing system-wide costs related to economic and environmental issues. Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP)	 an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP	 Pollution Routing Problem	 VRP in Reverse Logistics	 and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP	 discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP. It is hoped that OR/MS researchers together with logistics practitioners can be inspired and cooperate to contribute to a sustainable industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.											
AB Modem logistics is a new industry during the construction of national economy. Based on analyzing the environmental problem that was led by the limitation of the strategy during enacting the program of the modem logistics	 SEA for modem logistics was implemented. In this paper	 procedure and indicator system in the SEA are constructed	 and Environmental Check List to identify environmental impact factors of SEA for modem logistics is established. And a conception that indicates friendly degree of logistics system with resources and environment	 degree of green	 is introduced. With the example of modem logistics program of Dalian in China	 two methods are applied	 AHP and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method	 in the implement of SEA for modem logistics development. It is concluded that degree of green of modem logistics in Dalian is high. However	 several important factors should be paid much attention to in the SEA for modem logistics as well as in the formulation and implement of modem logistics in Dalian.							
AB In today's highly competitive environment	 green logistics issues are gaining interest. This paper analyses how logistics managers could lead the initiative in this area by incorporating environmental management principles into their daily decision-making process. A case study is given to show how they can turn practices into green while simultaneously meet the efficiency objectives. We have chosen one of the leader companies of the Spanish food distribution sector to check this hypothesis. The study covers the introduction of several changes into its fleet management and the implementation of a methodology to solve vehicle routing problems with environmental criteria minimisation.

AB Purpose - The interface between logistics service-providers (LSPs) and shippers is an area that has received little attention in previous research and even less has been done when environmental issues are added to this interface. Nonetheless	 the perception among researchers and the industry is that in many instances	 supply and demand in this green interface does not coincide. The purpose of this paper is	 therefore	 to identify the matches and gaps between LSPs' green supply and the shippers' green demand.												
AB Logistics and especially road transportation account for a major proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus	 increasing eco-sustainability is particularly important in this sector. Green information systems can support the transition towards more eco-sustainable business processes in logistics. To date research in Green IS has been dominated by conceptual and empirical studies	 while the community has been reluctant to do design science research developing IS artifacts. Addressing this gap	 we develop and evaluate a Green IS artifact for GHG emission tracking in road transportation processes - named Carbon Tracker. The design process was guided by design principles derived from prior Green IS literature. The artifact enables more eco-sustainable practices in logistics to emerge as it provides detailed information about GHG emissions that is indispensable for advanced organizational sense-and decision-making. The evaluation shows that the use of Carbon Tracker leads to more accurate and detailed information on emissions as well as more seamless and efficient workflows than today's best-practice approaches. Thus	 the paper demonstrates how Green IS can be leveraged for more eco-sustainable and efficient business processes and paves the way for further design-oriented research in the Green IS domain.												
AB The revision of Japan's Energy Conservation Law in April 2006 requires transporters and shippers to make efforts to protect the environment in their logistics activities. Fujitsu	 which has been active in green logistics for some time	 is expanding environmental load reduction activities across the entire supply chain	" setting a tough industry-leading target of reducing transport-related CO(2) emissions by 30% from fiscal 2000 levels by the end of fiscal 2010. This paper introduces Fujitsu activities toward this goal with a focus on ""reducing CO(2) emissions by using an intensive vehicle-allocation control system from parts procurement to product delivery"" in the Tokyo metropolitan area through modal shift expansion and the Green Logistics Partnership Promotion Project."													
AB Drawing on the innovation diffusion theory and data from 236 Chinese small and medium-sized logistics service providers (SMLSPs)	 this study developed and tested a conceptual model for empirically examining the green and cost benefits of integration between cloud service providers and SMLSPs in the Chinese context. The study posits that the perceived green and cost benefits drive the need for cloud computing (CC) adoption by Chinese SMLSPs. The results indicate that Chinese SMLSPs are attracted by CC to reduce cost in a short term and to gain sustainability through green benefits in a long term. The study extends CC capabilities and enterprise integration literature in the context of logistics services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.															
AB Food security continues to be an issue in various locations in the world	 with important challenges for domestic and international policies. Meanwhile	 modern food processing and advanced logistics increased the threats on food safety in areas where security is achieved. The paper addresses this topic by presenting and discussing the patterns of green logistics in food supply chains in the framework of sustainable development. It is emphasized the need to consider a different order of priority in the substantiation of supply chains	 in which local food products will gain a favored position. Short supply chains	 traditional products	 organic food and other means to promote food safety are also considered.											
AB This paper proposes a new model of simultaneous optimization of three-level logistics decisions	 for logistics authorities	 logistics operators	 and logistics users	 for regional logistics network with environmental impact consideration. The proposed model addresses the interaction among the three logistics players in a complete competitive logistics service market with CO2 emission charges. We also explicitly incorporate the impacts of the scale economics of the logistics park and the logistics users' demand elasticity into the model. The logistics authorities aim to maximize the total social welfare of the system	 considering the demand of green logistics development by two different methods: optimal location of logistics nodes and charging a CO2 emission tax. Logistics operators are assumed to compete with logistics service fare and frequency	 while logistics users minimize their own perceived logistics disutility given logistics operators' service fare and frequency. A heuristic algorithm based on the multinomial logit model is presented for the three-level decision model	 and a numerical example is given to illustrate the above optimal model and its algorithm. The proposed model provides a useful tool for modeling competitive logistics services and evaluating logistics policies at the strategic level.									
AB Urban green spaces provide various social and environmental benefits that strongly improve the quality of life in a city. Municipalities are responsible for maintaining their green spaces in order to preserve these potentials. This paper supports municipalities in planning the transportation and disposal logistics of the green waste that is produced by the maintenance activities. The approach combines ecological issues like the seasonality of green waste generation and different types of biomass with economically driven decision making. We show how to determine cost efficient transportation plans for the disposal logistics and how to capture the seasonality of green waste generation when booking capacities at disposal facilities. It is also shown how a municipality can select the disposal facilities to cooperate with in a competitive environment where facilities offer capacities at differing conditions	 as is the case for disposal sites that dump the green waste and for conversion plants that use the biomass for producing renewable energy. We illustrate the approach using case data of a major city in Germany. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.															
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality fit of nonlinear models	 gompertz and logistic data outside diameter	 longitudinal (DEL) and transverse (DET) fruits of green dwarf coconut trees	 as well as verification of the existence of residual autocorrelation. The results showed that for both	 DEL and DET	 the logistic model is most appropriate for describing the fruits growth. The fit of the models	 for both variables	 showed positive residual autocorrelation. For DEL	 the residual was modeled by a first order autoregressive process	 and for DET	 the autoregressive process was considered of second order. Consideration of the autoregressive process resulted in more accurate estimates of the parameters. According to the logistic model	 the fruit of the dwarf green	 fully developed	 have external diameters	 longitudinal and transverse	 respectively	 of 21.56cm and 15.35cm.
AB In April 2006	" the Revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy (Revised Energy Conservation Act) was enforced and both consigner businesses and transport operators were strongly demanded to take energy-saving measures in logistics. Fujitsu is a ""specified consigner"" that handles freight transport of more than a certain volume (30 million ton-km a year) and it is required to report on the actual reduction of CO2 emissions achieved with transport and energy-saving plans every year. Therefore"	 the entire Fujitsu Group is promoting activities to reduce the environmental impact related to logistics throughout its supply chain	 or green logistics activities. In the Environmental Action Plan	 Stage VII	 Fujitsu has set a target relating to the Group's logistics (domestic	" intra-region outside of Japan) of ""reducing by 2015 the CO2 emissions per sales from logistics by over 4% compared to 2011"" and is rolling out green logistics activities globally. This paper presents specific activities on which the Fujitsu Group is focusing to achieve this target"	" including ""modal shift expansion"" and ""reduction of vehicles by improving loading efficiency"" together with case examples."									
AB Built on the concepts of green supply chain management (G-SCM)	 this paper presents a multi-objective optimization programming approach to address the issue of nuclear power generation. In this study	 a linear multi-objective optimization model is formulated to optimize the operations of both the nuclear power generation and the corresponding induced-waste reverse logistics. Factors such as the operational risks induced in both the power generation and reverse logistics processes are considered in the model formulation. Numerical results indicate that using the proposed approach	 the induced environmental impact including the corresponding costs and risks can be improved up to 37.8%. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper presents a possible approach to the modelling of waste incinerators deployment in Slovakia within the purview of Green and Reverse logistics. Uneven distribution of certain waste incinerators types in the SR may lead to the efficiency reduction in waste collection and disposal. Building up the effective network of waste collection sites and waste incinerators depending on a type of waste and a number of separated components	 this presumes to satisfy the requirements of acceptable availability. In this process	 there can be as effective tools applied the location models	 based on the theories and methods of Mathematical programming. In this paper is applied the group of location models so as to optimise the deployment of waste incinerators.													
AB The aim of this paper is attempting to explore the optimal way of supply chain management within the domain of environmental responsibility and concerns. The background of this research involves the issue of green supply chain management (GSCM) and the concept of the multiobjective integrated logistics model. More specifically	 in this paper	 we suggest the fuzzy multiobjective integrated logistics model with the transportation cost and demand fuzziness to solve green supply chain problems in the uncertain environment which is illustrated via the detailed numerical example. Results and the sensitivity analysis of the numerical example indicate that when the governmental subsidy value increased the profits of the reverse chain also increased. The finding shows that the governmental subsidy policy could remain of significant influence for used-product reverse logistics chain.														
AB Road freight transportation is a major contributor to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Reducing these emissions in transportation route planning requires an understanding of vehicle emission models and their inclusion into the existing optimization methods. This paper provides a review of recent research on green road freight transportation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																
AB In this paper	 a sustainable industrial marketing framework of latest requirement of green and sustainable operation is proposed. When literatures in strategy	 marketing and operation have provided insight about the efficiency of reverse logistics and business value for the customer	 the interrelationship is still under explored. This raises the question whether manufacturers could determine ecological friendly strategies to address their customer's environmental conscious needs and design the suitable solution to strike the balance between ecology and economics. Based on the case study of a medical product manufacturer	 this study addresses this question by investigating how manufacturers identify the problem of reverse logistics; design and develop of sustainable product and service by enhancing the efficiency of operations	 and market competencies that add value to their customers' business processes. Within the strategy for designing for effective reverse logistics	 these findings contribute to understand the use of information system and technology for reverse logistics to enhance the customer's business process and provide value-added process for customer retention.

AB Due to the problem of global warming	 the green supply chain management	 in particular	 closed-loop logistics	 has drawn the attention of researchers. Although there were logistics models that were examined in the literatures	 most of them were case based and not in a closed-loop. Therefore	 they lacked generality and could not serve the purposes of recycling	 reuse and recovery required in a green supply chain. In this study	 the integration of forward and reverse logistics was investigated	 and a generalized closed-loop model for the logistics planning was proposed by formulating a cyclic logistics network problem into an integer linear programming model. Moreover	 the decisions for selecting the places of manufactories	 distribution centers	 and dismantlers with the respective operation units were supported with the minimum cost. A revised spanning-tree based genetic algorithm was also developed by using determinant encoding representation for solving this NP model. Numerical experiments were presented	 and the results showed that the proposed model and algorithms were able to support the logistic decisions in a closed-loop supply chain efficiently and accurately.			
AB Today consumers are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment	 and companies use these terms to promote their goods or services with eco-labels. Environmentally friendly (also eco-friendly	 nature friendly	 and green) are terms used to refer to goods and services	 laws	 guidelines and policies claiming to inflict minimal or no harm on the environment. Clothing is an integral part of our lives and green or environmental concerns have started to draw more and more attention in the textile and clothing sector. This paper analysed how green the textile and clothing industry is with respect to the product lifecycle	 from raw material through the design	 production and logistics up to disposal in order to point out important points and parameters for greening the industry.									
AB Purpose - Sustainability and environmental issues are among the most pressing concerns for modern humanity	 governments and environmentally conscious business organizations. Green supply chain management has been acknowledged as a key factor to promote organizational sustainability. Green supply chain management is evolving into an important approach for organizations in emerging economies to manage their environmental responsibility. Yet	 despite their importance for easing environmental degradation and providing economic benefits	 study of the drivers that influence green supply chain initiatives in an emerging economy is still an under-researched area. Using survey data collected from ISO 14001 certified organizations from Malaysia	 the purpose of this paper is to propose that the drivers that motivate firms to adopt green supply chain management can be measured by a second-order construct related to the implementation of the firm's green supply chain initiatives.												
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which the measures outlined in frameworks for guiding CO2e emissions reduction in road freight transport in the academic literature are actually being realised at a practical level.																
AB Nowadays	 issues on population	 environment and resource have become the world's attentive focus. Sustainable development has been widely accepted around the world. As one of the biggest waste generator and resources consumer	 manufacturing industry is facing more challenges as well as opportunities. In order to reduce both resource consuming and waste discharging effectively	 traditionally manufacturing mode should be improved. Newly emerged creative technologies and strategies	 including green design	 green manufacturing and cleaner production	 are regarded as the radical resolvent for current environment and resource issues and they will be the only way in the future that manufacturing will evolve. In this paper	 a serial of research on green design/manufacturing and cleaner product theoretically and practically was presented. These creative technology and strategy will give strong support to 'green' the whole electromechanical designing and manufacturing processes.								
AB Measuring and controlling emissions across the logistics network is an important challenge for today's firms according to increasing concern about the environmental impact of business activities. This paper proposes a bi-objective credibility-based fuzzy mathematical programming model for designing the strategic configuration of a green logistics network under uncertain conditions. The model aims to minimize the environmental impacts and the total costs of network establishment simultaneously for the sake of providing a sensible balance between them. A popular but credible environmental impact assessment index	 i.e.	 CO2 equivalent index is used to model the environmental impact across the concerned logistics network. Since transportation mode and production technology play important roles on the concerned objectives	 the proposed model integrates their respective decisions with those of strategic network design ones. In addition	 to solve the proposed bi-objective fuzzy optimization model	 an interactive fuzzy solution approach based upon credibility measure is developed. An industrial case study is also provided to show the applicability of the proposed model as well as the usefulness of its solution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.											
AB As environmental concerns becoming increasingly important to logistics service providers	 the question arises as to how they can achieve sustainable physical distribution practices while surviving the severe competition in freight transport. This issue is further complicated by the pressures from the many different shippers involved	 public expectations and regulating authorities. Therefore	 achieving sustainable physical distribution is definitely a wicked problem. In order to understand how logistics service providers attempt to tackle these problems	 a research study was conducted amongst logistics service providers who are frontrunners in implementing sustainability practices and who participate in the Lean and Green program	 to promote sustainability within the logistic chain in the Netherlands. Companies willing to participate in this award scheme	 must achieve the goal of reducing their CO2 production by 20% within a 5-year-period. The transport market is very competitive and sustainability is just one of the many logistical concerns that service providers must solve. Our research shows that the logistics service providers participating in the Lean and Green scheme preferred solutions which involved cooperative strategies over - third-parties solutions.										
AB Greening the supply chain is increasingly a concern for many business enterprises and a challenge for logistics management in the 21st century. Of particular concern is how to arouse organizational environmental awareness and put environmental activities into practice in the logistics activities of their supply chains. This paper investigates the correlation of two major factors	 organizational learning and management support	 with the extent of adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in Chinese manufacturing firms	 where their inbound and outbound logistics activities are potential polluters to the environment. Organizational and operational learning was derived from the firm's experience with programs such as total quality management and environmental management systems; Management support included support for GSCM ideas and practices from top and middle-level management and cooperation across organizational functions. We find significant positive relationships between organizational learning mechanisms	 organizational support and the adoption of GSCM practices	 after controlling for a number of other influences including regulations	 marketing	 supplier	 cost pressures	 industry levels of the relevant practice and organizational size. Implications of our findings on logistics management are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.							
AB Green Logistics (GL) has emerged as a trend in the management of the distribution of goods and the collection of end-of-life products. With its focus on maximizing the economic and environmental value by means of recycling and emission control	 GL contributes to the sustainable development of industry but also requires a more comprehensive transportation scheme when conducting logistics services. This. study is motivated by the practice of delivering and collecting water carboys. In this paper	 a Genetic Algorithm-based optimization model (GOM) is proposed for designing a green transportation scheme of economic and environmental cost efficiency in forward and reverse logistics. Two vehicle routing models with simultaneous delivery and pickup (full or partial pickup) are formulated and solved by a Genetic Algorithm. A cost generation engine is designed to perform a comprehensive cost comparison and analysis based on a set of economic and environmental cost factors	 so as to examine the impact of the two models and to suggest optimal transportation schemes. The computational experiments show that the overall cost is evidently lower in the full pickup model. Notably	 the impact of product cost after recycling and reusing empty carboys on total cost is more significant than the impact of transportation cost and CO2 emission cost. In summary	 the proposed GUM is capable of suggesting a guidance for the logistics service providers	 who deal with green operations	 to adopt a beneficial transportation scheme so as to eventually achieve a low economic and environmental cost.

AB We quantify the impact of jointly optimizing strategic network design and tactical inventory planning on the cost and CO2 emissions of multi-echelon logistics networks. The obtained insights indicate that longer optimized replenishment cycles reduce a node's transportation cost and CO2 emissions but increase its inventory costs. Moreover	 under a fixed replenishment cycle	 a node's service level increases when supplied by a satellite warehouse. Finally: (i) the costs of implementing optimal green network design decisions could be misleading if inventory planning is neglected	 (ii) greening of supply chains could become expensive	 (iii) current legislative CO2 ton prices hardly influence logistics networks.

AB This paper seeks to address the way in which economic and environmental performance can be measured simultaneously	 taking a multi-methodological approach to the logistics and supply chain management field in order to address sustainability challenges. The multi-methodological approach relies on the merits of different methodologies	 provides more flexibility in tackling problems under investigation	 and tolerates inaccurate estimation of parameters during the process. An illustrative case study (Westgate Ports) is undertaken in Australia in order to examine the ways in which the multi-methodological approach is applied	 and how it assists during the decision making process in the adoption of green practices for freight transport logistics. The case validates the applicability and usefulness of the approach and highlights comparative outputs of costs and carbon emissions in freight transport logistics. Rail transport is identified as giving the opportunity to study the short distance container and freight distribution network	 although initially this does not appear to be the most cost-effective option. This study finds that it is better to simultaneously consider performance indicators from different perspectives and to integrate them into one model of system measurement in order for corporations to improve their sustainability performance.

AB Policy makers in Denmark are increasingly recognising the potential health benefits associated with green space	 in particular with the use of green space. Knowledge on how green space is used	 why it is used	 and which factors influence its use	 is becoming interesting for researchers	 city planners and managers of green space. The present study is based on data from a nationwide study of 11 238 randomly selected adult Danes. Respondents were asked about the distance to four different types of green space	 their frequency of use of each of these types of green space	 and the main reasons for visiting green space. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between potential predictor factors and visits to green space at least a few times per week. Results show that 66.9% of the respondents live within 300 m of green space	 43.0% visit green space every day and 91.5% visit green space at least once a week. Only 0.9% never visit green space. To enjoy the weather and get fresh air is the most important reason for visiting green space for 87.2% of the respondents. Distance to green space is not a limiting factor for the majority of the Danish population and for that reason we recommend a thorough analysis of a neighbourhood or city	 its population	 and the available green spaces	 before deciding on a viable strategy to increase the use of green space.

AB In recent years	 both researchers and practitioners have devoted attention to environmental sustainability issues in the green supply industry	 but	 how to design the green logistic network in the eco-industrial system is missing. This article reports on the study of designing green logistic network in an eco-industrial system by modifying the Barabsi and Albert (BA) model based on the intrinsic properties of eco-industrial systems. After verifying that the modified BA model is more accurately to interpret the formation mechanism of an eco-industrial network by the mean-field approach	 paper extended and generalized some basic rules of the In-degree and Out-degree distributions of an EIN under the influences of different factors to assist eco-manufactures choose their supplier or customer	 even design their own supplying networks by application of complex networks theory with the aid of the Jinjie EIS case example.

AB In the twenty-first century	 transportation services and infrastructure will play a central role in the logistics systems of corporations competing in the global market. As transportation and logistics systems continue to integrate	 their impact on the physical environment will become a major issue. This study investigates the antecedents and outcomes of green technology innovation adoption in transportation companies in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey on the green technology innovation adoption of Malaysian transportation companies was conducted	 in which 252 samples were analysed. Based on the survey results	 this study finds that the quality of human resources	 customer pressure	 and environmental uncertainty significantly influence green innovation adoption for transportation companies	 while the influence of organizational and governmental support is not significant. In addition	 the findings of this study indicate that there is a significant relationship between green technology innovation adoption and environmental outcome. The practical implications of the research findings are discussed.								
AB Environmental protection is becoming more and more important for enterprises because of stronger public awareness	 competitors and communities	 and government regulations. For this purpose	 some programs have become more popular for raising environmental awareness including total quality environmental management and green supply chain management. Reducing the environmental pollution from upstream to downstream during procuring raw materials	 producing	 distribution	 selling products	 and products depreciation is the most important goal of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). The main contribution of this study is introducing the main factors in green supply chain management that are very important in environmental attributes by providing an evaluation framework to select the most eligible green suppliers by examining the influential and important criteria and subcriteria among ten elements of two main GSCM practices	 namely	 green logistics and environmental protection. First	 these factors are divided into two groups	 that is	 green logistics and environmental protection	 and then by applying DEMATEL technique	 the complex causal relationship between all factors dependencies and feedbacks among them is examined. Finally	 by drawing the impact relationship map the most important and influential factors are determined for improving green supply chain environmental aspects.	
AB Purpose - Extant research has yielded conflicting results regarding the relationship between adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to further investigate this relationship by examining the case of green reverse logistics (GRL).																
AB Purpose - The pressure on logistics companies to embrace green processes has increased significantly in the last few years. Within the broad concept of green supply chain management	 a review of the existing literature has highlighted a need to understand how green supply chain practices (GSCP) can contribute to improving company performance from an environmental point of view	 as well as economic and operational. This paper aims to investigate the GSCP adopted by third party logistics (3PLs) in Italy in terms of specific practices implemented and level of adoption of each practice	 and to explore how this adoption can affect the company performance.													
AB We investigate how various ecological modernisation forces in terms of environmental regulations	 customer pressure	 and economic pressure are associated with the implementation of green logistics management (GLM) by Chinese export manufacturers to manage the logistics life cycle of their products. Based on survey data from 128 Chinese export manufacturers	 we find that customer pressure is a significant factor affecting the extent of their GLM implementation	 which in turn is positively associated with their environmental	 financial	 and operational performance. Contrary to our expectation and previous findings on environmental management in developed countries	 both environmental regulations and economic pressure are not significant drivers for Chinese export manufacturers to pursue GLM.

AB The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a critical and vital problem in logistics for the design of an effective and efficient transportation network	 within which the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) has been widely studied for several decades due to the practical relevance of logistics operation. However	 CVRP with the objectives of minimizing the overall traveling distance or the traveling time cannot meet the latest requirements of green logistics	 which concern more about the influence on the environment. This paper studies CVRP from an environmental perspective and introduces a new model called environmental vehicle routing problem (EVRP) with the aim of reducing the adverse effect on the environment caused by the routing of vehicles. In this research	 the environmental influence is measured through the amount of the emission carbon dioxide	 which is a widely acknowledged criteria and accounts for the major influence on environment. A hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is designed to solve the EVRP model	 and the performance of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated through comparing with well-known CVRP instances. The computational results from numerical experiments suggest that the hybrid ABC algorithm outperforms the original ABC algorithm by 5% on average. The transformation from CVRP to EVRP can be recognized through the differentiation of their corresponding optimal solutions	 which provides practical insights for operation management in green logistics.

AB This paper looks at the implications of various maritime emissions reductions policies for maritime logistics. There can be important trade-offs that have to be made between the environmental benefits associated with such measures as reduction in steaming speed and change in the number of vessels in the fleet	 and more conventional logistics attributes such as in-transit inventory holdings.

AB With the urgency of global warming	 green supply chain management	 logistics in particular	 has drawn the attention of researchers. Although there are closed-loop green logistics models in the literature	 most of them do not consider the uncertain environment in general terms. In this study	 a generalized model is proposed where the uncertainty is expressed by fuzzy numbers. An interval programming model is proposed by the defined means and mean square imprecision index obtained from the integrated information of all the level cuts of fuzzy numbers. The resolution for interval programming is based on the decision maker (DM)'s preference. The resulting solution provides useful information on the expected solutions under a confidence level containing a degree of risk. The results suggest that the more optimistic the DM is	 the better is the resulting solution. However	 a higher risk of violation of the resource constraints is also present. By defining this probable risk	 a solution procedure was developed with numerical illustrations. This provides a DM trade-off mechanism between logistic cost and the risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose - In response to increasing demands on improved environmental performance	 companies need to develop their capabilities in assessing the environmental performance of their operations. Knowledge among practitioners as well as solid research results in this area is lacking. This paper aims to present a framework of dimensions	 which are important to consider regarding environmental measurement in supply chain management. The paper also aims to present a practical example on how environmental performance measurements can be a success by applying these dimensions.														
AB As today's consumers are more and more concerned with the environmental impacts of products and services they buy	" enterprises have been more and more concerned with ""green operations"". One of the key aspects of green logistics management is reverse logistics. This paper shows how the potential of managing reverse logistics flows can be implemented in the agro-industrial sector. As an example"	" the palm oil supply chain is considered. This study is carried out under the focus of the ""closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) framework"" in which forward and backward product flows are considered simultaneously. A mathematical model is proposed in order to represent the dynamic interaction between flows. The objective function considers energy"	 cost and economic profits. Different implementation scenarios of recovery processes are proposed and interactions between direct and reverse flows in the chain are evaluated. Results are analyzed using proper statistical tools	 showing that the simultaneous analysis of direct and reverse flows positively impact the net economic profits in this complex supply chain of the agro-industrial sector.

AB The analysis of development and application of the effects of green practices is in the center of both theorethical and practical interest of modern retail. In light of this	" the effects of ""green strategy"" are being researched throughout the value chain in order to improve business performance in retail. Concidering it"	 this paper analyses characteristics and the effects of green practices on the performance in retail. Global retailers are increasingly struggling with high costs	" especially energy costs. The development and implementation of green practices contributes to significantly discounted ""surplus"" of retail costs. This is particularly proven by numerous empirical results of research"	 primarily based on analysis of annual reports of global retailers	 which are leaders in implementing green strategies in their business. As a result	 the green practice is	 together with other modern concepts	 treated as very effective tool of cost management in retail. With effective application it significantly contributes to improving overall performance in retail.								
AB The worldwide economic growth of the last century has given rise to a vast consumption of goods while globalization has led to large streams of goods all over the world. The production	 transportation	 storage and consumption of all these goods	 however	 have created large environmental problems. Today	 global warming	 created by large scale emissions of greenhouse gasses	 is a top environmental concern. Governments	 action groups and companies are asking for measures to counter this threat. Operations Research has a long tradition in improving operations and especially in reducing costs. In this paper	 we present a review that highlights the contribution of Operations Research to green logistics	 which involves the integration of environmental aspects in logistics. We give a sketch of the present and possible developments	 focussing on design	 planning and control in a supply chain for transportation	 inventory of products and facility decisions. While doing this	 we also indicate several areas where environmental aspects could be included in OR models for logistics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.		
AB The purpose of the study was to construct a model in order to understand the empirical effects of the task environment on reverse logistics resource commitment and the resulting performance. The Taiwanese computer	 communication	 and consumer electronics (3C) manufacturing and retail industries were investigated by questionnaire administration. Structural equation modelling was employed to model relationships among the latent constructs of the task environment	 resource commitment	 and environmental and economic performances. From 349 valid responses	 it was found that the task environment has a positive and significant influence on resource commitment. In turn	 resource commitment positively and significantly influences the economic and environmental performances of reverse logistics separately. Additionally	 environmental performance significantly and positively influences economic performance	 thus showing that it pays to be green. Under a climate of increasingly strict international regulations	 governmental legislation and the increase in consumer environmentalism	 firms are advised to appropriately reappraise their RL resource commitments.						
AB The relationship between green supply chain initiatives and performance outcomes has been subject to numerous studies but the results are not conclusive. This study tries to assess the actual environmental	 economic and intangible outcomes resulting from the adoption of green supply chain initiatives. This study used a structured questionnaire derived from the literature and employing a mail survey to collect responses form a group of 569 ISO 14001 certified firms in Malaysia. The results of testing the hypotheses that predicted that green supply chain initiatives have positive effect on the outcomes showed that eco-design have significant positive effect on the four types of outcomes (environmental outcomes	 economic outcomes	 cost reductions	 and intangible outcomes). Reverse logistics was found to have significant positive effect on cost reductions only. However	 green purchasing was not found to have significant effect on any of the four types of outcome. Through designing environmentally friendly products and taking back products and packaging	 business organizations can generate benefits to the environment	 in the form of reduced waste and better resource utilization	 in addition to economic benefits and cost reductions to the organizations.

AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) has become a practical approach to develop environmental performance. Under strict regulations and stakeholder pressures	 enterprises need to enhance and improve GSCM practices	 which are influenced by both traditional and green factors. This study developed a causal evaluation model to guide selection of qualified suppliers by prioritizing various criteria and mapping causal relationships to find effective criteria to improve green supply chain. The aim of the case study was to model and examine the influential and important main GSCM practices	 namely	 green logistics	 organizational performance	 green organizational activities	 environmental protection	 and green supplier evaluation. In the case study	" decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique is applied to test the developed model. The result of the case study shows only ""green supplier evaluation"" and ""green organizational activities"" criteria of the model are in the cause group and the other criteria are in the effect group."							
AB Organizations realize that a strong supporting logistics or electronic logistics (e-logistics) function is an important organizational offering from both the commercial and the consumer perspective. The implications of e-logistics models and practices cover the forward and reverse logistics functions of organizations. They also have a direct and profound impact from an environmental perspective. Focuses on a discussion of forward and reverse e-logistics and their relationship to the natural environment. The issues analyzed include those of traditional green logistics and supply chain management functions such as: inventory management	 transportation	 warehousing	 delivery management	 supplier management	 packaging and order management. Issues relevant to each of these major areas from the electronic commerce and natural environment overlap are discussed. Examples of practices and results are integrated. Environmental issues facing reverse e-logistics are also described. Brings to the forefront the reverse e-logistics function	 which has been selcom studied even from a non-environmental perspective. After discussion of the many pertinent issues in these areas	 direction of practice and implications for study and research are then presented.									
AB Growth and age at reproductive maturity are two life-history parameters that add an important temporal component to species conservation	 yet such information is seldom available for plethodontid salamanders. We modeled growth and age at maturity for a northern West Virginia population of Green Salamanders	 Aneides aeneus	 using snout-vent length (SVL) growth intervals from a five-year mark-recapture study. Growth data were fit to the von Bertalanffy and logistic growth interval models and compared using the residual error mean square. The logistic model provided the best fit to the recapture data	 indicating that Green Salamanders grow slowly for plethodontids and that it takes 7-8 yr to reach reproductive maturity. Our results revealed that Green Salamanders mature at a later age than most plethodontid species	 indicating that the species might have greater generation time and longevity than previously suspected. Our data may offer insight into why the species is sensitive to population declines. Thus	 we suggest that future research focus on Green Salamander longevity and generation time to provide a framework from which comparisons can be made across populations.										
AB The value chain of many business enterprises is increasingly required to demonstrate the profitability of their primary activities	 starting from inbound logistics to operations	 outbound logistics	 marketing sales	 and finally to services. The adoption of green logistics management (GLM) presents an opportunity for Chinese manufacturing exporters to competently respond to the escalating expectation of the international community for resources conservation and to achieve environmental performance profitably. This study makes several important contributions to the literature on managing logistics with environmental considerations. First	 the authors identify the components of GLM: (i) procedure-based practices	 (ii) evaluation-based practices	 (iii) partner-based practices	 and (iv) general environmental management practices. Second	 they relate GLM to environmental and operational performance in a developing country context. Third	 they identify the institutional and operational antecedents that prompt the adoption of GLM by export-oriented manufacturing enterprises in China. Fourth	 they examine the moderating effect of environmental regulatory pressure on the GLM-performance linkage. The results are based on a survey of manufacturing exporters in China. The commonly held view that economic motivation is related to the adoption of GLM is not supported. However	 GLM positively affects both environmental and operational performance	 and regulatory pressure enhances the GLM-performance relationship. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.			
AB Many companies around the world have started to realise that working alone will not be sufficient in their move towards a greener supply chain (SC). More specifically	 recent UK government regulations on implementing strict CO2 reduction encourage SC operators to work collaboratively	 in production and logistics and in other operations	 to achieve their green objectives. In this research	 we look at some underlying factors of SC collaboration	 focussing on suppliers	 logistics and retailers	 for the purpose of improving the environmental sustainability of companies' SCs. To facilitate our study	 we conduct case studies in two overseas supplier companies with the aim of providing a better understanding of how green issues imposed by European and UK customers influence the companies' actions to meet agreed environmental goals. Then	 staff in middle-management and related roles in sixteen companies operating in the UK are interviewed to understand their business practices in achieving the goal of CO2 reduction. Finally	 drawing upon the information from company reports and websites	 a number of UK leading retailers' actions to reduce CO2 emissions are investigated. We develop a conceptual framework of three levels of SC collaboration for environmental sustainability to help companies improve their level of collaboration between suppliers and buyers in terms of meeting their environmental objectives. The proposed framework will serve as a base model for the companies using or considering SC collaboration to achieve their environmental agendas	 in line with governmental green regulatory requirements.

AB Collection and recycling of product returns is gaining interest in business and research worldwide. Growing green concerns and advancement of green supply chain management (GrSCM) concepts and practices make it all the more relevant. Inputs from literature and informal interviews with 84 stakeholders are used to develop a conceptual model for simultaneous location-allocation of facilities for a cost effective and efficient reverse logistics (RL) network. We cover costs and operations across a wide domain and our proposed RL network consists of collection centers and two types of rework facilities set up by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their consortia for a few categories of product returns under various strategic	 operational and customer service constraints in the Indian context.															
AB Green marketing and green supply chain have been drawing the attention of both academics and practitioners in the recent decade. However	 no holistic framework has been developed on how to build green industrial brands and industrial corporate brands. Whether or not sustainable/green supply chains can be integrated with green industrial marketing in building greener organizations and industrial brands is still unclear. In addition	 little is known on the factors on green new industrial product development or how green new industrial products are adopted by organizations. Furthermore	 we know little of whether and how green supply chain enables green new industrial product development. This special issue aims at reflecting the most recent advances on green industrial marketing	 green/sustainable supply chains and their interplay in green industrial branding	 and to explore future research directions. The guest editors hope that the solicited papers can provide insights on the impacts of sustainable or green supply chains on marketing theory in industrial and business-to-business markets.

AB Traditional oak and ash coppices are used to provide numerous useful products	 including bark for tanneries and fire wood for bakeries. When these markets disappeared	 most of the coppice stands have been replaced by high forests	" at the costs of the specific natural values which coppices do provide. The emerging renewable energy market could create a new outlet for the woody biomass from coppices. The project's aim was to set up and demonstrate the validity of a ""double green"" supply chain"	 including the harvest	 logistics	 cominution and delivery of the coppice biomass at the gate of a power plant. Double green refers to the green energy generated	 and also to the positive ecological effects when coppice management is restored to a regular cutting cycle. A new Dutch subsidy program makes it more appealing for forest owners to put their woodlands back into a coppice management regime. A number of practical problems related to harvesting and logistics still remain to be solved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									
AB Intrinsic characteristics of food products and processes along with growing sustainability concerns lead to the need for decision support tools that can integrate economic considerations with quality preservation and environmental protection in food supply chains. In this study	 we develop a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model for a generic beef logistics network problem. The objectives of the model are (i) minimizing total logistics cost and (ii) minimizing total amount of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation operations. The model is solved with the e-constraint method. This study breaks away from the literature on logistics network models by simultaneously considering transportation emissions (affected by road structure	 vehicle and fuel types	 weight loads of vehicles	 traveled distances)	 return hauls and product perishability in a MOLP model. We present computational results and analysis based on an application of the model on a real-life international beef logistics chain operating in Nova Andradina	 Mato Grosso do Sul	 Brazil and exporting beef to the European Union. Trade-off relationships between multiple objectives are observed by the derived Pareto frontier that presents the cost of being sustainable from the point of reducing transportation emissions. The results from the pie chart analysis indicate the importance of distances between actors in terms of environmental impact. Moreover	 sensitivity analysis on practically important parameters shows that export ports' capacities put pressure on the logistics system; decreasing fuel efficiency due to the bad infrastructure has negative effects on cost and emissions; and green tax incentives result in economic and environmental improvement.

AB Purpose - A commonly suggested measure to make logistics greener is a shift to intermodal road-rail transportation. Most research addresses the issue from the carrier's perspective	 arguing for ways to improve the service production to better fit the shippers' demand. In this article the issue is addressed from the shipper's perspective. The purpose is to understand what contextual factors and operations changes that are possible and/or necessary for the shipper to make a fit to the current production system.															
AB The number of green buildings certified under voluntary	 third-party rating systems has been growing	 as has the number of jurisdictions that require or incentivise such certification. In this paper	 we use logistic and linear regression to demonstrate that for all cities in the US with population greater than 50	000	 there is a statistically significant relationship between the presence of a municipal green building policy and the number of registered green buildings (those still under construction)	 but not the number of certified buildings. We present very strong evidence that the presence of a policy is indeed leading to more green buildings	 rather than demographic or other factors.									
AB Business leaders worldwide are proclaiming their interest in increasingly ambitious environmental initiatives. However	 external observers	 particularly not-for-profit organisations	 are criticising the trend of many companies towards green communication or posturing rather than action	 termed 'green-washing'. Our purpose is to establish a link between companies' green strategic intent and their concrete initiatives in the supply-chain area. Drawing from the institutional theory	 we expect that green supply-chain practices are following different patterns and transforming across time	 according to different institutional contexts. We point out here that green-washing represents a primarily needed step towards further concrete actions and results. We expect that different institutional contexts lead to different types of green supply-chain behaviours. Analysis of data from a large-scale survey of 600 international companies using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and logistic regression provided clear evidence that firms are following different patterns when they implement a green strategy to their supply chain.										
AB The present work aims to support tactical and operational planning decisions of reverse logistics systems while considering economic	 environmental and social objectives. In the literature	 when addressing such systems economic aspects have been often used	 while environmental concerns have emerged only recently. The social component is the one less studied and rarely the combination of the three concerns has been analyzed. This work considers the three objectives and was motivated by the challenge of supporting decision makers when managing a real case study of a recyclable waste collection system	 where strategic decisions on the number and location of depots	 vehicles and containers were taken beforehand. Tactical and operational decisions are studied involving the establishment of service areas for each depot and the definition and scheduling of collection routes for each vehicle. Such decisions should represent a compromise solution between the three objectives translating a sustainable reverse logistics plan. The problem is modeled as a multi-objective	 multi-depot periodic vehicle routing problem with inter-depot routes. A mathematical formulation and a solution approach are proposed. An approximation to the Pareto front is obtained for the case study and the trade-offs between the objectives are discussed. A balanced solution is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a research about the widely accepted knowledge management modes and their interaction with important and fresh processes for the company as the reverse logistics activities	" commonly called ""green logistics"". Knowledge is an important intangible for any area of the organization"	 especially in the case of logistics of products that are returned to organization because it implies a huge uncertainty and costs. Due to new customer policies	 new and higher environmental laws and recover of discarded materials which supposes a new low cost source of raw material the returns are increasing for the companies. The relationship between both areas establishes new and positive effects on flexibility and performance of the organization. Due to the complexity and extension of this research we have divided it into two papers	 this first one represents the theoretical background of this research	 and the second paper is focused on the empirical contrast of hypothesis and results for this investigation. Thus	 this first article has shown a theoretical approach regarding how the modes of knowledge conversion	 specifically the creation of knowledge	 affects reverse logistics and analyses new relations between these variables and their joint influence on the flexibility of distribution of information (because information has a key role for these variables) and performance of the organization. A second paper will show the empirical contrast for these constructs.								
AB In recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of hazardous materials in retail activities	 resulting in heightened concern about hazardous wastes ending up in landfill. In response	 environmental legislation has been enacted to increase re-use and recycling by placing responsibility on producers and distributors for the collection	 treatment and recovery of hazardous waste. This has had direct impacts on the type	 number and location of treatment/disposal facilities and the design	 planning and management of the associated logistics networks. This study has investigated the legislative	 contractual and operational practices governing the management of five hazardous waste streams emanating from retailers in a dedicated shopping centre. Using a substantial database of logistics operations compiled from 92 businesses	 the study quantifies the considerable transport footprint currently associated with hazardous waste logistics and discusses the scope for coordinated collection strategies across supply chains potentially using local treatment facilities.									
AB The strategic application of reverse supply chain logistics to improve the reclamation of products at the end of their useful life is gaining increased attention. The environmental implications of reclamation	 reuse	 and recycling to save landfill space	 fuel	 and costs are becoming more important for organizations. The social and ethical dimensions of sustainability	 particularly as they apply to reverse logistics	 are emerging topics. The focus of existing reverse logistics research has been on the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability - social sustainability has yet to be comprehensively examined. This paper focuses on addressing this gap in the literature by linking various sustainable indicators with various reverse logistics practices to develop a profile of reverse logistics for social sustainability. By compiling practical	 international examples from practice and research	 we have used the structure of social sustainability to highlight reverse logistics for social sustainability. The paper concludes with some topics for future research. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons	 Ltd and ERP Environment.							
AB The purpose of this study is to identify how sustainable hotel practices impact the satisfaction and intention to return of hotel guests from different nationalities. Surveys were completed by hotel guests in a popular tourist destination in Mexico. Multiple regression and multinomial logistic regression were applied to test the hypotheses. Results of this study supported the research hypotheses that indicate green practices overall do have a positive relationship on guests' satisfaction levels and return intentions for Mexicans	 Americans and other nationalities. Additionally	 it was shown that the relative importance of green practices differs according to the nationality of the guest. Published by Elsevier Ltd.														
AB Purpose - The theoretical framework for market-oriented sustainability developed by Crittenden	 Crittenden	 Ferrell	 Ferrell	 and Pinney	 in which the relationship between organizational culture and performance management is theorized as moderated by stakeholder involvement	 is empirically assessed. The paper aims to discuss these issues.										
AB This paper explains the strategy and procedures followed by the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) to spread green Purchasing practices throughout its administration and supply chain	 highlighting the identified barriers against their implementation and monitoring	 and showing the actions carried Out to overcome them. The University's green supply chain management has been analysed in five selected case studies: office material	 recycled toner cartridges	 fair trade coffee	 reusable glass bottles and catering services. These cover the wide range of purchasing patterns Currently taking place at UAB taking into account both the acquisition model (directly or indirectly through contracted firms) and the Supply chain management perspective (linear or loop). A comparison of the different cases is carried Out and some general rules are created that Should be investigated further. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.											
AB Capsule Green Woodpeckers exhibited strong feeding-site preference	 choosing areas based on abundance of ants with additional micro-habitat effects.															
AB Recently	 many companies have recognized the concepts of green supply chain management or supply chain environmental management. However	 relatively little research attention has been devoted to the consideration of relations between greening the supply chain	 green innovation	 environmental performance and competitive advantage. Hence	 this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence to encourage companies to implement green supply chain and green innovation in order to improve their environmental performance	 and to enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. A model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey across 124 companies from eight industry sectors in Taiwan. The data are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling and the results from the final measurement model are used to evaluate the structural model that verifies the significance of the proposed relationships. A prominent result of this study is that greening the supplier through green innovation contributes significant benefits to the environmental performance and competitive advantage of the firm.

AB The burgeoning environmental regulations are forcing companies to green their supply chains by integrating all of their business value-adding operations so as to minimize the impact on the environment. One dimension of greening the supply chain is extending the forward supply chain to collection and recovery of products in a closed-loop configuration. Remanufacturing is the basis of profit-oriented reverse logistics in which recovered products are restored to a marketable condition in order to be resold to the primary or secondary market. In this paper	 we introduce a multiechelon multicommodity facility location problem with a trading price of carbon emissions and a cost of procurement. The company might either incur costs if the carbon cap	 normally assigned by regulatory agencies	 is lower than the total emissions	 or gain profit if the carbon cap is higher than the total emissions. A numerical study is presented which studies the impact of different carbon prices on cost and configuration of supply chains.												
"AB Growing environmental concerns have motivated businesses to carefully assess the environmental impact of their products and services at all stages of a life-cycle. Reverse logistics plays an important role in achieving ""green supply chains"" by providing customers with the opportunity to return the warranted and/or defective products to the manufacturer. An efficient reverse logistics structure may lead to a significant return on investment as well as a significantly increased competitiveness in the market. In order to ensure efficiency"	" many organizations outsource their reverse logistics activities by engaging third-party logistics providers that implement reverse logistics programs designed to gain value from returned products. The selection of third-party providers is a crucial step in initializing reverse logistics related practices. This study aims to efficiently assist the decision makers in determining the ""most appropriate"" third-party reverse logistics provider using a two-phase model based on artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic in a holistic manner. A numerical example is also included in the study to demonstrate the steps of the proposed model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."															
AB This paper aims to investigate the impact of lean	 resilient and green supply chain management practices on supply chain sustainability. A deductive research approach was used to derive a conceptual model. Eighteen research propositions are suggested and tested with empirical data derived from five case studies belonging to the Portuguese automotive supply chain. A conceptual model to assess the impact of lean	" resilient and green practices on supply chain sustainability was derived from the data analysis. The practices with significant impact on supply chain sustainability are: ""waste elimination"	" supply chain risk management"" and ""cleaner production."" The following lean"	" resilient and green supply chain management practices do not have a significant impact on supply chain sustainability: ""flexible transportation"	 flexible sourcing	 ISO 14001 certification	" and reverse logistics."" The paper provides a taxonomy for lean"	 resilient and green supply chain management practices at three levels: upstream	 organization and downstream. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as a checklist to identify possible practices to achieve their sustainability goals. The proposed model makes it possible for researchers to develop surveys in order to better explore the proposed relationships. This paper presents an innovative approach since it studies simultaneously the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental	 social and economic)	 and the lean	 resilient and green supply chain management paradigms which are considered strategic for supply chain competitiveness. Identification of the conceptual relationships between supply chain management practices and sustainability is a contribution that the authors hope will become a forward step in the development of new theoretical approaches and empirical research in the field of supply chain management and sustainability.

AB Reverse logistics (or the reverse supply chain) features greater relative uncertainty when compared to forward logistics and supply chain flows. An effective way to manage uncertainty and variance in operational and organizational systems is by introducing greater flexibility. The literature on flexibility in reverse logistics is surprisingly sparse	 with an explicit focus on flexibility in reverse logistics nonexistent in the literature. To address this gap in the literature	 and building upon literature in supply chain flexibility	 we introduce a reverse logistics flexibility framework. The framework is separated into operational and strategic flexibilities. Operational flexibility includes a variety of dimensions such as product and volume flexibility across various reverse logistics operational functions. We have also included strategic flexibility categorized into network and organizational design flexibility dimensions. Additional sub-dimensions are also included in the framework. The framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as process improvement or programmatic evaluation. The framework is also useful as a theoretical construct for reverse logistics empirical research. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a performance evaluation of third party reverse logistics providers model using a novel neighborhood rough set approach. Using illustrative data	 sensitivity results help evaluate the neighborhood rough set technique's robustness with various reverse logistics performance factors. This paper sets the foundation for significant future research in reverse logistics flexibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.												
AB We propose an efficient evolutionary multi-objective optimization approach to the capacitated facility location-allocation problem (CFLP) for solving large instances that considers flexibility at the allocation level	 where financial costs and CO2 emissions are considered simultaneously. Our approach utilizes suitably adapted Lagrangian Relaxation models for dealing with costs and CO2 emissions at the allocation level	 within a multi-objective evolutionary framework at the location level. Thus our method assesses the robustness of each location solution with respect to our two objectives for customer allocation. We extend our exploration of selected solutions by considering a range of trade-offs for customer allocation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.														
AB This paper addresses a multi-product multi-period Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) where multiple capacitated vehicles distribute products from multiple suppliers to a single plant to meet the given demand of each product over a finite planning horizon.																
AB Among the leading environmental risks	 global climate alteration has become one of the most important controversial issues. Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2	 methane	 etc.) and air pollution have motivated a need to develop and improve environmental management strategies. As a consequence	 environmental sanctions are forcing commercial enterprises to re-consider and re-design supply chain processes in a green way. This article provides a multi-objective model to design a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network in a green framework. Our first and second objectives are to minimize all the transportation costs for the supply chain's forward and reverse logistics; the third objective is to minimize total CO2 emissions; the fourth objective is to encourage customers to use recyclable materials as an environmental practice. To provide more realistic modeling by treating the uncertainty in decision-makers' objectives	 fuzzy modeling is used in this study. The model is explained and tested via fulfilling a numerical example. In scenario analyses	 analytic hierarchy process (AHP)	 fuzzy AHP (F-AHP)	 and fuzzy TOPSIS (F-TOPSIS) approaches were applied and compared to evaluate different objectives to guide decision-makers.								
AB Due to green legislations	 industries track the used products through reverse logistics contractors. A reverse logistics programme offers significant cost savings in procurement	 transportation	 disposal and inventory carrying. Since reverse logistics operations and the supply chains they support are considerably more complex than traditional manufacturing supply chains	 it can be offered to third party contractors. But availability of more number of contractors make evaluating and selecting the most efficient Reverse Logistics Contractor (RLC) a challenging task and treated as a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper	 a hybrid method using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is proposed. AHP is used to obtain the initial weights and Fuzzy TOPSIS is used to get the final ranking. A case study demonstrates the application of the proposed method. Finally sensitivity analysis is carried out to confirm the robustness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.											
AB Consumers and legislation have pushed companies to re-design their logistic networks in order to mitigate negative environmental impacts. The objective in the design of logistic networks has changed	 therefore	 from cost minimization only	 to cost and environmental impact minimization. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework for the design and evaluation of sustainable logistic networks	 in which profitability and environmental impacts are balanced. In this paper	 we review the main activities affecting environmental performance and cost efficiency in logistic networks	 we show the advantages of using multi-objective programming (MOP) to design sustainable networks	 we present the expected computational difficulties of using the MOP approach in the design of sustainable networks	 and we introduce a technique	 based on the commonalities between data envelopment analysis (DEA) and MOP	 to evaluate the efficiency of existing logistic networks. The European pulp and paper industry will be used to illustrate our findings. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.						
AB Recent reviews of the literature on ship routing and scheduling note the increased attention to environmental issues. This is an area of paramount importance for international shipping and will be even more so in the future. This short communication is motivated by the increasing attention to 'green' routing and scheduling and outlines some possible ways to incorporate the air emissions dimension into maritime transportation OR. The main contribution of this note vis-a-vis the state of the art is that it conceptualizes the formulation of the 'Green Ship Routing and Scheduling Problem' (GSRSP) based on existing formulations and highlights all the important parameters of the problem.

AB The research reported in this paper examines the buying behaviour of shippers in France in respect of their purchasing of logistics services	 and in particular their attitudes towards purchasing more ecologically sound services. We have conducted empirical measurements of the gap between shippers' declared willingness to purchase ecologically sound services and their actual buying behaviour regarding offers of logistics services	 and have proposed a research model to explain this gap. This research is a significant extension of earlier pilot study work in the French Picardy region	 such that the study area now covers 4 regions	 representing approximately 64% of the demand for logistics services in France. Based upon 172 valid survey responses received	 the statistical testing of our explanatory research model has revealed three main antecedents of ecological buying behaviour: perceived compatibility between the quality levels of ecological logistics services available and traditional logistics services; the visibility of the shipper's individual ecological actions within the overall supply chain; and the shipper's overall basic ecological strategy anchored at the corporate level. According to the results of this survey	 these company-specific antecedents are a more important influence on purchasing behaviour than relational aspects and regulatory constraints.										
AB This work investigates the problem of negotiations between producers and reverse-logistics (RL) suppliers for cooperative agreements under government intervention. Utilizing the asymmetrical Nash bargaining game with uncertainties	 this work seeks equilibrium negotiation solutions to player agendas. Analytical results indicate that financial intervention by a government generates a significant effect on the relative bargaining power of green supply chain members in negotiations. Over intervention by a government may result in adverse effects on chain members' profits and social welfare. Furthermore	 a bargaining framework underlying the duopoly-oligopoly context may contribute to a negotiation outcome most profitable for green supply chain members. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Environmental awareness	 green directives	 liberal return policies	 and recycling of materials are globally accepted by industry and the general public as an integral part of the product life cycle. Reverse logistics reflects the acceptance of new policies by analyzing the processes associated with the flow of products	 components and materials from end users to re-users consisting of second markets and remanufacturing. The components may be widely dispersed during reverse logistics. Radio frequency identification (RFID) complying with the EPCglobal (2004) Network architecture	 i.e.	 a hardware- and software-integrated cross-platform IT framework	 is adopted to better enable data collection and transmission in reverse logistic management. This research develops a hybrid qualitative and quantitative approach	 using fuzzy cognitive maps and genetic algorithms	" to model and evaluate the performance of RFID-enabled reverse logistic operations (The framework revisited here was published as ""Using fuzzy cognitive map for evaluation of RFID-based reverse logistics services"""	 Proceedings of the 2009 international conference on systems	 man	 and cybernetics (Paper No. 741)	 October 11-14	 2009	 San Antonio	 Texas
AB In real applications	" we may be confronted with the problem of informative censoring. Koziol-Green model is commonly used to model the possible information contained in the informative censoring. However the proportionality assumption cast by Koziol-Green model (see (1.2) below) is ""too restrictive in that it limits the scope of the Cox model in practice"" (see Subramanian"	 2000). In this paper	 we try to relax the proportionality condition of Koziol-Green model by modeling the censorship semiparametrically. It is shown that our suggested semiparametric censoring model is an applicable extension of the Koziol-Green model. Through a close connection with the logistic regression	 our model assumptions are readily to be checked in practice. We also propose estimation for both the regression paxameter and the cumulative baseline hazard function which can incorporate the additional information contained in the serniparametric censorship model. Simulations and the analysis of a real dataset confirm the applicability of the suggested model and estimation.												
AB In green logistics operation	 all logistics processes form a bidirectional closed-loop topology. In order to model and optimize such a kind of structure	 a standardized closed-loop logistics operation reference model is built which aims to provide supply chain managers with general analysis. Based on the reference model	 potential risks of closed-loop logistics chain can be analyzed including not only the visible forward and reverse logistics flow but also the invisible information flow. A qualitative decision-making model for different logistics organizations under risk is proposed and a profit function is developed according to logistics management decision-making process of all logistics nodes under different risks. The proposed model considers different risk management strategy problems. The optimization problem is described as a multi-objective decision-making problem with minimization of the risk loss as well as risk management cost and maximization of the profit. The profit model is solved by genetic algorithm. In the model	 in order to express uncertainties of different risk preference information	 risk is assessed by a three-dimensional vector in priority	 probability and loss. A quantified reference model is introduced through a three-dimensional vague vector map	 where several information gathering methods based on vague set are discussed and compared through a case study.									
AB With heightened public concern about the environmental impacts (e.g. global warming	 ozone layer depletion) of products and manufacturing processes	 the evaluation of environmental impacts during the lifecycle of the products has become a crucial issue. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been developed to evaluate environmental impact of existing products and existing manufacturing processes	 but the current LCA tools are not suitable for the evaluation of whole product lifecycles and cannot evaluate the logistics of product lifecycles	 which are crucial factor in designing feasible and efficient product lifecycles. This paper proposes a modelling and simulation environment called Green Production and Logistics Simulator (GPLS) for evaluation and design of green product lifecycles. The proposed environment employs the concepts of modular modelling	 model template	 Multi-Dimensional Formalism (MDF) and process inventory	 and has the ability to model costs	 qualities and logistics. MDF defines a paradigm for the explicit representation of physical	 behavioural	 and operational perspectives or dimensions of the plant	 process	 and product. This is the basis for the development of simulation environments in which various product lifecycle alternatives are explored with the same simulation models. The case study	 in which the PET bottle resin lifecycle was modelled and simulated	 was implemented as a software tool and was shown to be convenient and efficient means to evaluate various product lifecycle alternatives.		
AB Whilst green homes have been constructed by housing developers in Malaysia	 developers should determine how satisfied homeowners are with their green homes. This paper first reviews data from a survey to determine the satisfaction level of homeowners towards their residence in terms of green features in Iskandar Malaysia. Next	 factor analysis is carried out to identify benefits that motivate households to own green homes	 and then followed by logistic regression analysis to determine the effects of motivators on housing satisfaction. Results show that homeowners are most satisfied with the green features of high ceiling	 North-South orientation	 double-glazed panel glass doors and windows	 solar panel system and landscaped parks with facilities. Rain water harvesting system and low-flow water fixtures	 on the other hand	 are the least satisfied green features among homeowners. Four motivators are found that describe households' belief about green homes: 'Financial Incentives'	 'Healthy and Sustainable Environment'	 'Energy Efficiency' and 'Livability'. The findings also demonstrated that the extent of housing satisfaction may depend on what motivates homeowners to own green homes. It would seem that house buyers do not just demand a typical house to stay in but also sustainable houses that do not compromise the environment.						
AB Based on institutional theory	 this study investigates the effects of three institutional pressures on top managers' posture towards reverse logistics implementation: government	 customer	 and competitor pressures. Survey data from 209 manufacturers of Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China reveal that institutional pressures have a statistically significant positive influence on top managers' posture towards reverse logistics implementation. in addition	 while top managers' posture is strongly related to product recovery	 it is not related to product return. We also find that product recovery has a significant positive effect on a firm's economic and environmental performance. Conversely	 the results suggest that product return negatively affects a firm's economic performance and has no effect on environmental performance. We highlight the managerial implications.

AB The legal and social pressure to recycle materials is constantly on the increase. As a result of the physical characteristics of glass and its large-scale use	 the glass-producing sector represents one of the most important in terms of volume when implementing reverse logistics practices. This article studies the relationships with suppliers and customers from the perspective of environmental demands on the part of the packaging and bottling companies that use this material. The study compares the results obtained in two European countries	 Spain and Belgium	 which present very different characteristics as regards consumer habits and recycling. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper reports on research undertaken to determine the baseline trends in logistics and supply chain management and associated environmental effects up to 2020. Factors affecting freight transport demand	 truck fuel consumption and related CO2 emissions are classified into six categories in relation to different levels of logistical decision-making. The projections are based on the results of seven focus group discussions and a large-scale Delphi survey. Three scenarios are constructed to assess CO2 emission levels from road freight transport in 2020. The likely changes in the key logistics variables are discussed and the complexity of the problem is highlighted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.															
AB Driven by new laws and regulations concerning the emission of greenhouse gases	 carriers are starting to use electric vehicles for last-mile deliveries. The limited battery capacities of these vehicles necessitate visits to recharging stations during delivery tours of industry-typical length	 which have to be considered in the route planning to avoid inefficient vehicle routes with long detours. We introduce the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (E-VRPTW)	 which incorporates the possibility of recharging at any of the available stations using an appropriate recharging scheme. Furthermore	 we consider limited vehicle freight capacities as well as customer time windows	 which are the most important constraints in real-world logistics applications. As a solution method	 we present a hybrid heuristic that combines a variable neighborhood search algorithm with a tabu search heuristic. Tests performed on newly designed instances for the E-VRPTW as well as on benchmark instances of related problems demonstrate the high performance of the heuristic proposed as well as the positive effect of the hybridization.										
AB Knowledge of the influence of environmental factors on weed populations is important in developing sustainable turfgrass management practices. Studies were conducted to evaluate the relationship of green and false-green kyllinga population densities with elevation and edaphic factors in turfgrass systems. Studies were conducted on five different golf courses in North Carolina	 three affected by green kyllinga	 and two affected by false-green kyllinga. According to Spearman correlation coefficients	 both green and false-green kyllinga were correlated with increasing soil volumetric water content	 whereas correlation of other edaphic variables varied among sites and species. Stepwise logistic regression confirmed the correlation of volumetric water with green kyllinga presence	 but model components varied among sites for false-green kyllinga. Increasing green kyllinga populations correlated with increasing soil sodium; however	 sodium did not reach a level believed to be detrimental to turfgrass growth. No other variables correlated with green or false-green kyllinga across all sites. We hypothesized that the lack of significant correlations was due to the overall influence of relative elevation on edaphic variables. According to principal components analysis (PCA)	 relative elevation had a profound impact on the measured edaphic variables at all sites. However	 results of PCA at one site differed sharply from other sites. Results from that site demonstrate the potentially strong effects of management practices to alter edaphic trends normally observed with topography.								
AB There have been increasing concerns about the adverse impacts on the environment caused by cargo movement in international trade. Different stakeholders ranging from shippers and carriers to government bodies and international communities have expressed worries about the environmental impacts brought by shipping related activities. The pollution and waste created in the shipping processes have imposed environmental burdens and accelerated resource depletion. The situation is set to worsen in the face of intensifying trade globalization	 which has contributed to sustained growth in international shipping activities. To help protect the environment	 many shipping firms have taken the initiative to find ways to lessen the environmental damage of their operations while enhancing their performance. The objective of this study is to examine the environmental awareness and the environmental measures taken in the shipping industry. We propose a conceptual framework for evaluating green shipping practices and develop several propositions stating the conditions under which shipping firms would behave in an environmentally responsible manner. We conclude with managerial and policy implications of the conceptual framework to promote green shipping practices in the shipping industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the deployment of pro-active and re-active practices in the implementation of green supply chain management (GSCM) and analyze their impact on environmental	 economic	 and intangible performance by considering business strategy as organizational focus.														
AB Automatic inspection and classification of printed circuit board (PCB) defects remains a problem in the Integrated Circuit (IC) industry. In a small volume	 large production variety environment	 some of the widely used defects classification tools are the Bayes classifier	 the linear discriminant function (LDF) classifier	 the minimum distance classifier	 and the K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) classifier. These classifiers all have shortcomings and their applications are limited. This study proposes the logistic regression tree as classifier where each node implements a logistic regression model to make a binary split	 and draws a comparison with other classifiers. This experiment uses the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values of an image with PCB golden fingers	 as opposed to some features extracted from the image. The golden fingers defects considered in this study are scuffing	 blotted tin	 exposed nickel	 and unplating. The result of this experiment shows that the logistic regression tree has an accuracy of 89.33%	 while other classifiers can only achieve 81.67% to 87.17%. Furthermore	 the decision flexibility and the result stability show that the logistic regression tree is an excellent choice as a classifier.				
AB Operations management researchers and practitioners face new challenges in integrating issues of sustainability with their traditional areas of interest. During the past 20 years	 there has been growing pressure on businesses to pay more attention to the environmental and resource consequences of the products and services they offer and the processes they deploy. One symptom of this pressure is the movement towards triple bottom line reporting (3BL) concerning the relationship of profit	 people	 and the planet. The resulting challenges include integrating environmental	 health	 and safety concerns with green-product design	 lean and green operations	" and closed-loop supply chains. We review these and other ""sustainability"" themes covered in the first 50 issues of Production and Operations Management and conclude with some thoughts on future research challenges in sustainable operations management."									
AB Quantitative microbial risk assessments do not usually account for the planning and ordering mechanisms (logistics) of a food supply chain. These mechanisms and consumer demand determine the storage and delay times of products. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the difference between simulating supply chain logistics (MOD) and assuming fixed storage times (FIX) in microbial risk estimation for the supply chain of fresh-cut leafy green vegetables destined for working-canteen salad bars. The results of the FIX model were previously published (E. Franz	 S. O. Tromp	 H. Rijgersberg	 and H. J. van der Fels-Klerx	 J. Food Prot. 73:274-285	 2010). Pathogen growth was modeled using stochastic discrete-event simulation of the applied logistics concept. The public health effects were assessed by conducting an exposure assessment and risk characterization. The relative growths of Escherichia coli O157 (17%) and Salmonella enterica (15%) were identical in the MOD and FIX models. In contrast	 the relative growth of Listeria monocytogenes was considerably higher in the MOD model (1.156%) than in the FIX model (194%). The probability of L. monocytogenes infection in The Netherlands was higher in the MOD model (5.18 x 10(-8)) than in the FIX model (1.23 x 10(-8)). The risk of listeriosis-induced fetal mortality in the perinatal population increased from 1.24 x 10(-4) (FIX) to 1.66 x 10(-4) (MOD). Modeling the probabilistic nature of supply chain logistics is of additional value for microbial risk assessments regarding psychrotrophic pathogens in food products for which time and temperature are the postharvest preventive measures in guaranteeing food safety.										
"AB State governments in the United States have adopted a number of policies to encourage the production of electricity from ""green"" energy sources. While these state-level policies have been shown to stimulate green electricity development"	 the rate at which such policies have been adopted by the states differs significantly. This paper examines the potential influence of a state's particular social	 political	 and economic interests on its propensity to adopt green electricity policies. We use an empirical model that combines various social	 political and economic indicators as explanatory variables of a state's likelihood to adopt four specific green electricity policies: renewable portfolio standards	 net metering rules	 public benefits funds	 and generation disclosure rules. Using binary logistics regressions	 the results suggest that social interests	 measured by the level of income	 the level of education	 and the degree of participation in environmental lobbying groups	 are positively linked to the adoption of green electricity policies. Similarly	 political interests as measured by the pro-environment voting by states' representatives in the U.S. Congress	 also play a positive role in the adoption of such policies.

AB Green supply chain management has emerged as a proactive approach for improving environmental performance of processes and products in accordance with the requirements of environmental regulations. Various approaches for implementing green supply chain management practices has been proposed and recognized in previous literatures	 yet no investigation has identified the reliability and validity of such approaches particularly in electronic industry. This study examines the consistency approaches by factor analysis that determines the adoption and implementation of green supply chain management in Taiwanese electronic industry. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method is applied to prioritize the relative importance of four dimensions and twenty approaches among nine enterprises in electronic industry. The findings indicate that these enterprises would emphasize on supplier management performance in the crucial role of implementing green supply chain management. Establishing an environmental database of products	 asking for product testing report and top management support are among the most important approaches. The results for the implications of green supply chain management implementation in electronic industry investigated in this work generate a generic hierarchy model for decision-makers who can prioritize those approaches for implementing green supply chain management in Taiwan.														
AB Background: There is accumulating evidence that greater availability of green space in a neighbourhood is associated with health benefits for the local population. One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for	 and therefore encourages	 physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However	 research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods.													
AB Many of the management practices that contribute to improving a firm's environmental performance are developed in the area of logistics management. The aim of this work is to contribute to identifying the factors determining the implementation of these practices by studying two variables: the environmental pressure of the stakeholders as perceived by the firm and the values and beliefs of its managers. The analysis of data provided by 186 industrial firms reveals that two dimensions of pressure can be distinguished	 governmental and non-governmental	 and that only the latter is able to explain the implementation of environmental practices in logistics. The empirical results also confirm the effect of management's values and reveal that part of this effect is channelled through the influence of these values in the perception of environmental pressure.														
"AB Recent social science scholarship on ""green"" consumption (consumption promoted as relatively environmentally friendly) has connected it to social status"	 positioning it as an opportunity for consumers to signal their social status conspicuously. I show that the practice of green consumption does appeal to the relatively well-educated	 but argue that the social differentiation implicated in green consumption occurs	 in part	 through the expression of tastes that do not rely on conspicuous signaling and that are contingent on the symbolic nature of the goods themselves. The paper employs a logistic regression analysis on national data from a 2008 ABC News/Discovery Channel/Stanford University survey of American adults to show that an increasing level of education is positively related to the odds of finding green consumption desirable. Being female	 having children under the age of 18 years old in the home	 and identifying as an environmentalist are also positive predictors. These findings are situated in existing literature on green consumption and interpreted using the theoretical contributions of Pierre Bourdieu (1984	 2005) in Distinction and The Social Structures of the Economy. The result is an engagement with scholarship on green consumption that is both theoretically and empirically informed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									
AB Background Green tea	 a popular beverage in Japan	 contains many polyphenolic antioxidants	 which might prevent atherosclerosis. This study was designed to determine whether the consumption of green tea is proportionately associated with a decreased incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular prognosis.													
AB The last mile problem comprises one of the most costly and highest polluting segments of the supply chain in which companies deliver goods to end customers. The recent trend towards green supply chains and social and environmental responsibility has led to many new green initiatives. One business strategy gaining popularity involves retailers offering home delivery. This paper performs a comprehensive comparison of carbon emissions resulting from conventional shopping involving customer pickup with trip chaining versus e-commerce-based online retailing involving last mile delivery to customers' homes. The break-even number of customers for carbon emissions equivalence is determined and analysed for the feasibility of last mile delivery at a desired service level based on the radius of the demand region and the delivery time available. A methodology for calculating the difference in expected carbon emissions is formulated and demonstrated to quantify which method has the least harmful impact on the environment.																
AB Purpose. The aim of the study was an evaluation of the quantitative parametric analysis of contrast-enhanced lesions in dynamic MR mammography.																
AB In China	" ""green"" integrated waste management methods are being implemented in response to environmental concerns. We measured the air quality at several municipal solid waste (MSW) sites to provide information for the incorporation of logistics facilities within the current integrated waste management system. We monitored ambient air quality at eight MSW collecting stations"	 five transfer stations	 one composting plant	 and five disposal sites in Beijing during April 2006. Composite air samples were collected and analyzed for levels of odor	 ammonia (NH3)	 hydrogen sulfide (H2S)	 total suspended particles (TSPs)	 carbon monoxide (CO)	 sulfur dioxide (SO2)	 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The results of our atmospheric monitoring demonstrated that although CO and SO2 were within acceptable emission levels according to ambient standards	 levels of H2S	 TSP	 and NO2 in the ambient air at most MSW logistics facilities far exceeded ambient limits established for China. The primary pollutants in the ambient air at Beijing MSW logistics facilities were H2S	 TSPs	 NO2	 and odor. To improve current environmental conditions at MSW logistics facilities
AB The success of inventory management in organizations is the presumption for optimal functioning of the supply chains. With the advent of the reverse logistics and the broader concept of the Green supply chain management	 management of reverse flows of materials and therefore appropriate methodologies and models for inventory management with returns	 have become topics of interest to researchers and in practice. Most scientific papers in the literature	 however	 observe inventory management with returns from the position of the manufacturer	 while inventory management problems of reclaimed products somehow remained on the sidelines by their retailers. For this reason	 research was undertaken on the current status	 potentials and problems of inventory management of recovered products (parts) in the aftersales automotive industry in Croatia.									
AB The role of product architecture modularity is commonly in increasing product reusability and minimizing waste. This paper designs a decision support system to determine optimal product architecture modularity in closed loop supply chains. The objective is to investigate if remanufacturing and modular upgrading is appropriate at certain periods and in modules. The optimization model is tested under several production yield scenarios in order to determine manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity and production line scheduling under process yield uncertainty. The implications of product architecture modularity for operations economy of green supply chains are discussed in terms of their theoretical and managerial aspects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Future increases in the potential yield of wheat will require an improvement in the photosynthetic area in early growth stages. Our aim was to investigate the genotypic and environmental effects on the pattern of leaf and green area development of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. cv. durum). Twenty-five genotypes were grown during 2 years under irrigated and rainfed conditions in Lleida (northeastern Spain). Leaf area index (LAI) and green area index (GAI) were determined on eight occasions from seedling to maturity and data were fitted to an asymmetric logistic peak Curve. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess the Curve characteristics responsible for differences between years	 sites and genotypes. Genotypic differences in the pattern of changes in LAI and GAI from sowing to maturity were not statistically significant	 indicating a lack of genetic diversity for these traits in the germplasm used in this study. A decrease in the peak of the curves of 27% for LAI and 35% for GAI was observed under tainted conditions compared to the irrigated site. Drought caused a lengthening of crop development until anthesis of about 2% (3-4 days). Contrarily	 the time from sowing to the maximum LAI and GAI values were reduced by drought in around 10%	 causing an acceleration of the onset of plant senescence. Once started	 the senescence of the green organs of the plant was more rapid at the irrigated than at the rainfed site. It is Concluded that LAI and GAI patterns were more influenced by the environment (mainly water availability) than by the genotype. The results Suggest a certain degree of independent regulation for phenological development and the swiftness of green area accumulation in the plant. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) is a stoloniferous and rhizomatous prostrate weed displaying high growth rates under non-limiting conditions. Radiation has been considered the major factor affecting C. dactylon patch extension and biomass growth	 but little is known about the influence of water availability on those processes. C. dactylon green area and biomass growth were analysed in response to different soil water conditions. Four experiments comprising eight drought treatments were carried out during 2 years at different dates	 to generate a wide range of soil water and evaporative demand conditions. Significant reductions in weed green area and biomass growth were found between treatments when low soil water conditions were imposed. Reductions in green area were of greater magnitude than reductions in biomass	 suggesting a higher effect of drought on green area increment. There were significant (P < 0.05) relationships between green area increment and cumulative incident radiation	 although slopes [relative green area growth rates (RGAGR)] differed among treatments. A strong logistic relationship was found between RGAGR and the ratio of plant-available soil water to potential evapotranspiration. The approach and parameters generated in this work can be used to predict C. dactylon growth changes under rain-fed conditions.												
AB This study examines the association between objectively measured access to green space	 frequency of green space use	 physical activity	 and the probability of being overweight or obese in the city of Bristol	 England. Data from the 2005 Bristol Quality of Life in your Neighbourhood survey for 6821 adults were combined with a comprehensive GIS database of neighbourhood and green space characteristics. A range of green space accessibility measures were computed. Associations between accessibility and the odds of respondents achieving a recommended 30 min or more of moderate activity five times a week	 or being overweight or obese	 were examined using logistic regression. Results showed that the reported frequency of green space use declined with increasing distance. The study also found that respondents living closest to the type of green space classified as a Formal park were more likely to achieve the physical activity recommendation and less likely to be overweight or obese. The association with physical activity	 but not with overweight or obesity	 remained after adjustment for respondent characteristics	 area deprivation	 and a range of characteristics of the neighbourhood environment. The findings suggest that the provision of good access to green spaces in urban areas may help promote population physical activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.						
AB Environmental awareness is increasingly important to society	 government	 and industry	 and there is a strong demand for sustainable development practices. The importance of supply chain management is critical	 as it characterizes and influences the life cycles of all products. Within the major logistics trends	 outsourcing has a significant potential to increase sustainability in the supply chain as third-party logistics providers (3PLs) focus on improving resource utilization and making processes more efficient. However	 their motivation is largely economic	 and an environmental perspective is rarely seen in 3PLs. As consumers demand greener alternatives and	 subsequently	 environmental regulatory measures are implemented	 3PLs will have to become more environmentally and socially aware in order to develop sustainability goals. This study compares two scenarios using life-cycle assessment (LCA): one where logistics functions are handled in-house	 and an alternative scenario where such functions are outsourced to a 3PL. The impacts of logistics outsourcing on energy utilization	 global warming potential	 and fatalities are first quantified in the supply chain of an automobile. Even though vehicle operation	 responsible for most of the impacts considered	 is outside the domain of logistics functions	 logistics outsourcing nonetheless has the potential to reduce energy use and global warming potential by 0.4-2% and fatalities by 0.8-3.3% throughout the entire life cycle of a typical automobile. Road and air transportation are found to account for most of the impacts in all selected metrics. Analyzing logistics outsourcing in the other sectors of the U. S. economy revealed the same trend as observed in the supply chain of an automobile.
AB The Kyoto Protocol calls for industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from 1990 levels by 2008-2012	 so developed countries are presenting various policies to reduce greenhouse gas that is produced in transport fields. One of those polices is a modal shift that changes from road freight to sea	 inland waterways and railroad transportation that is eco-friendly. The increase of road freight brings road congestion	 accidents	 logistic costs	 air pollution and greenhouse gases. Railroads are superior to the other modes of transportation in mass transportability	 high speed	 timeliness	 safety and environmental-friendliness	 but the railway industry has been pushed behind in competition. Korean railroads were used by passengers and for freight transport popularly until the middle of the 20th century. However	 because of the sudden change of logistics environments	 having time efficiency being most important	 railroads lost logistic competitive power against the transportation by truck. This paper intends to examine the modal shift to railroad transportation	 which enjoys high interest as environmentally-friendly logistics	 i.e.	 the modal shift strategy. Efficiency analysis is conducted using DEA and exploratory factors are identified for the modal shift of the companies. This paper also proposes an alternative plan for green logistics and environmentally-friendly logistics	 by analyzing the characteristics of the railroad cargo transportation system and the conditions of local railroad cargo transportation.
AB Study objectives: To investigate the strength of the relation between the amount of green space in people's living environment and their perceived general health. This relation is analysed for different age and socioeconomic groups. Furthermore	 it is analysed separately for urban and more rural areas	 because the strength of the relation was expected to vary with urbanity.														
AB In the new decade	 green investment decisions are attracting more interest in design supply chains due to the hidden economic benefits and environmental legislative barriers. In this paper	 a supply chain network design problem with both economic and environmental concerns is presented. Therefore	 a multiobjective optimization model that captures the trade-off between the total logistics cost and CO2 emissions is proposed. With regard to the complexity of logistic networks	 a new multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm known as a multiobjective Gravitational search algorithm (MOGSA) has been implemented for solving the proposed mathematical model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model	 a comprehensive set of numerical experiments is explained. Theresults obtained show that the proposed model can be applied as an effective tool in strategic planning for optimizing cost and CO2 emissions in an environmentally friendly automotive supply chain.											
AB This work presents an evaluation model that adopts several important criteria based on benefits	 opportunities	 costs	 and risks (BOCR) perspective	 enabling the collecting strategy of reverse logistics (RL) of the Taiwan photovoltaic industry (TPI) supply chain is the most appropriate. Major criteria weights are analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and sensitivity analysis. Analysis results indicate that the proposed evaluation model enables the collecting strategy of RL in the TPI supply chain more objectively by allowing them to deploy effectively. Importantly	 the proposed model can provide the TPI accreditation strategy in RL a reference material	 making it highly applicable for academia and commercial purposes.										
AB The textile and clothing industry generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. Fast fashion products shorten the valid lifecycle and generate more waste than regular clothing products. Considering the features of fashion products	 a system of a rent-based closed-loop supply chain is developed to improve the sustainability of fashion products. The supply chain processes (fashion design and manufacturing	 laundry	 logistics and disposal)	 the operations management issues (inventory management	 closed-loop logistics	 human-clothing matching	 booking system and the rental pricing) and the sustainability promotion aspects (customization	 responsive system	 culture and policy aspects) are investigated by devising sustainable strategies. The rationalities of the developed system and strategies are reviewed and elucidated in detail. The results may contribute to building sustainable closed-loop fashion supply chains	 the related information systems and operational and managerial mechanisms.						
AB The objective of the present work was to develop a techno-economic system model to evaluate how logistics and production parameters affect the torrefaction supply chain costs under Swedish conditions. The model consists of four sub-models: (1) supply system	 (2) a complete energy and mass balance of drying	 torrefaction and densification	 (3) investment and operating costs of a green field	 stand-alone torrefaction pellet plant	 and (4) distribution system to the gate of an end user. The results show that the torrefaction supply chain reaps significant economies of scale up to a plant size of about 150-200 kiloton dry substance per year (kton(DS)/year)	 for which the total supply chain costs accounts to 31.8 euro per megawatt hour based on lower heating value ((sic)/MWLHV). Important parameters affecting total cost are amount of available biomass	 biomass premium	 logistics equipment	 biomass moisture content	 drying technology	 torrefaction mass yield and torrefaction plant capital expenditures (CAPEX).

AB Carbon emissions are an increasingly important consideration in sustainable environmental development. In the green building industry	 green construction cost controls and low-carbon construction methods are considered to be the key barriers encountered. Based on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy	 management of carbon emissions from green building projects contributes to the acquisition of accurate building cost information and to a reduction in the environmental impact of these projects. This study focuses on the CO2 emission costs and low-carbon construction methods	 and proposes a 0-1 mixed integer programming (0-1 MIP) decision model for integrated green building projects	 using an Activity-Based Cost (ABC) and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) the integrated model can help construction company managers to more accurately understand how to allocate resources and funding for energy saving activities to each green building through appropriate cost drivers; (2) this model provides a pre-construction decision-making tool which will assist management in bidding on environmentally-friendly construction projects; and (3) this study contributes to the innovation operation research (OR) literature	 especially in regard to incorporating the life cycle assessment measurement into construction cost management by utilizing a mixed decision model for green building projects.

AB Aims: To investigate the associations between green space and health	 health-related quality of life and stress	 respectively. Methods: Data were derived from the 2005 Danish Health Interview Survey and are based on a region-stratified random sample of 21	832 adults. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews followed by a self-administered questionnaire	 including the SF-36	 which measures eight dimensions of health and the Perceived Stress Scale	 which measures self-reported stress. A total of 11	238 respondents completed the interview and returned the questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between distance to green space and self-perceived stress. Results: Danes living more than 1 km away from the nearest green space report poorer health and health-related quality of life	 i.e. lower mean scores on all eight SF-36 dimensions of health than respondents living closer. Respondents living more than 1 km away from a green space have 1.42 higher odds of experiencing stress than do respondents living less than 300 m from a green space. Respondents not reporting stress are more likely to visit a green space than are respondents reporting stress. Reasons for visiting green spaces differ significantly depending on whether or not respondents experience stress. Respondents reporting stress are likely to use green spaces to reduce stress. Conclusions: An association between distance to a green space and health and health-related quality of life was found. Further	 the results indicate awareness among Danes that green spaces may be of importance in managing stress and that green spaces may play an important role as health-promoting environments.							
AB Environmental issues	 resource re-usage and information technology applications (ITA) are gaining interest in supply chain management researches. Critical environmental legislation has become common in all level of company operations. Green product design has a significant influence on the cost of purchase	 disassembly	 component inspection and repair	 remanufacturing and recycling. Recently	 the development and improved capabilities of ITA have changed the ways in which the supply chain operates. However	 the traditional inventory model considers a case in which depletion of inventory is caused by a constant rate. In practice	 there is an inventory loss due to deterioration. This paper investigates the impact of the green product design	 the deteriorating factor and the ITA investment in business process considering remanufacturing. An integrated inventory deteriorating model is developed	 considering green product design and remanufacturing. The integrated production-inventory deteriorating model for replenishment policy and distribution planning is derived utilising a time-weighted inventory approach. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the theory. The results show that new technology evolution	 reusable-item take-back ratio and direct shipment are the critical operation factors in green product design and ITA investment.						
AB Increasing the use of urban green space has appeared on the political agenda	 primarily because increased use is expected to improve the health and well-being of the urban population. Green space is contributing to restoring mental fatigue	 serving as a resource for physical activity	 reducing mortality and reducing the level of stress.													
AB The paper contributes to research on sustainability in dyadic buyer-supplier relationships of logistics services. It presents deeper knowledge on why and how suppliers choose to behave sustainably. The research analyzes how shippers stimulate their LSPs and how LSPs respond by conducting sustainability activities. Agency theory and the stimulus-organism-response model are applied as the theoretical foundations for an explorative case study analysis of three large and five small and medium-sized European logistics service providers (LSPs) active in road transport services. Significant differences are found between the sustainability efforts of SMEs and large LSPs and a tentative taxonomy of the sustainability response types of LSPs is derived. The taxonomy contributes to theory-guided research in sustainable supply chain management and procurement. Thereby	 mismatches of stimuli and responses are identified and related agency problems in dyadic relationships in terms of sustainability are discussed. From a managerial point of view	 the findings may serve as a starting point for purchasers of logistics services to develop adequate sustainability selection criteria and incentives.

AB Objective: Green tea has been found to possess anti-inflammatory	 anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic properties. The present study examines the association between green tea drinking and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its interactions with other risk or protective factors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of inflammation and oxidative stress related genes. Methods: A population-based case-control study with 204 primary HCC cases and 415 healthy controls was conducted in Taixing	 China. Epidemiological data were collected using a standard questionnaire. SNPs of genes of the inflammation and metabolic pathways were genotyped at the UCLA Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory. Logistic regression was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Longer duration and larger quantities of green tea consumption were inversely associated with primary HCC. Individuals who drank green tea longer than 30 years were at lowest risk (adjusted OR = 0.44	 95% CI: 0.19-0.96) compared with non-drinkers. A strong interaction was observed between green tea drinking and alcohol consumption (adjusted OR for interaction = 3.40	 95% CI: 1.26-9.16). Green tea drinking was also observed to have a potential effect modification on HBV/HCV infection	 smoking and polymorphisms of inflammation related cytokines	 especially for IL-10. Conclusion: Green tea consumption may protect against development of primary HCC. Potential effect modifications of green tea on associations between primary HCC and alcohol drinking. HBV/HCV infection	 and inflammation-related SNPs were suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									
AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) integrates ecological concepts with those of supply chain management in order to minimize energy and material usage and to reduce adverse impacts of supply chain activities on the environment. GSCM implementation in mining industries depends largely upon certain factors which are influenced by human behaviours. Human behaviour is dynamic in nature and the relationships between them continuously evolve and change. In this ever-changing context	 therefore	 identifying and ranking the behavioural factors that affect GSCM implementation becomes essential. This can be taken as a reference by the decision makers while deciding the hierarchy of action necessary for effective implementation of green practices in mining supply chains. The present research attempts to explore various behavioural factors affecting GCSM practices and their interactions which help to attain green-enabled needs. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) is employed in this research to extract the interrelationships among the identified behavioural factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The sustainable development of shipping and port operations has attracted increasing attention of the shipping community. Of particular concern is the environmental damage caused by shipping-related activities. In this study we evaluate the external cost incurred from barge and containership usage in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region and	 based on this external cost	 determine the environmental damage caused by container shipping activities in the region. Applying the external cost approach	 we classify the ports in the region into feeder ports	 direct ports	 and hub ports. Our analysis suggests that three green shipping networks servicing the region can be developed. Our findings provide policy makers with helpful guidance on ways to strengthen the logistical capability of the PRD region while reducing the environmental harm from shipping activities.

AB Green lacewings are pertinent bio-indicators of an ecosystem's health. An example for detecting temporal changes in crop field biodiversity over a short period by sampling chrysopids is given. Light-trapping collections over ten years near Bucharest ( Romania) implied changes in the species assemblages. The main species present were members of the Chrysoperla carnea-complex. They increased from 38 to 72% of the total Chrysopidae in samples. The faunistic richness (Margalef's index) only decreased by about 9% of its initial value. Shannon's diversity and Hurlbert's equitability indices showed a high level of biodiversity for an agri-environment. Nevertheless	 they decreased significantly by about 45% over time	 attesting to a loss in biodiversity. Statistical analysis by linear and logistic regressions shows that the progressive dominance of the common green lacewings is realistic	 and constitutes indication of change in crop field biodiversity.													
AB The objective of this article is to analyse how green supply chain management (GSCM) practices are being adopted by some high-tech companies located in Brazil. The research was conducted using the case study approach	 focusing on eight companies that are representative of this sector. The main results are: (a) the most adopted GSCM practices in the studied high-tech companies located in Brazil are internal environmental management	 investment recovery and reverse logistics and (b) Brazilian environmental legislation and international policies are very important in driving the adoption of GSCM practices. The internationalisation of companies was also found to be a variable that interferes with the adoption of GSCM practices. This is one of the first studies that examine the relationship between GSCM and the internationalisation of companies located in Brazil.														
AB In this paper	 a green strategy for systematic design of waste-to-energy supply chain is proposed. The presented green strategy includes efficient resources management and reduction of carbon footprint of a waste-to-energy supply chain. A novel two-stage optimisation model (macro- and micro-stage) is developed in this work. Micro-stage involves the optimisation and allocation of waste (e.g.	 biomass	 industrial waste	 etc.)	 as well as the design of integrated processing hub. Meanwhile	 macro-stage handles the synthesis and optimisation of waste-to-energy supply network. Based on the optimised result	 the operation and logistics management of the waste can be determined. In addition	 the optimum technologies which convert waste into value-added products are determined. An actual case study that geographically based on west coast of Peninsular Malaysia was developed to illustrate the proposed strategy. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.								
AB This paper aims to approach to the reality of the environmental marketing in the Spanish industry	 identifying	 on the one hand	 the most salient green practices in this sector and	 on the other hand	 the profiles of companies more prone to adopt them. Findings suggest that	 in general terms	 more socially visible organizations are more interested in environmental marketing practices. In addition	 it is also observed that the implementation degree of environmental modifications in internal processes related to logistics and product design is superior to market-directed actions	 mainly oriented to promote and communicate the organization's environmental behaviour.							
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of reverse logistics on order and inventory variance amplification in a single-echelon supply chain (SC) and to propose a new order policy for dampening such amplification.																
AB Background: Although green tea or its constituents might reduce psychological stress	 the relation between green tea consumption and psychological distress has not been investigated in a large-scale study.															
AB Background: As a result of increasing urbanisation	 people face the prospect of living in environments with few green spaces. There is increasing evidence for a positive relation between green space in people's living environment and self-reported indicators of physical and mental health. This study investigates whether physician-assessed morbidity is also related to green space in people's living environment.															
AB Objective. To examine the association between green tea consumption and tooth loss.																
AB Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity ( in general	 and more specifically	 walking and cycling during leisure time and for commuting purposes	 sports and gardening) is an underlying mechanism in the relationship between the amount of green space in people's direct living environment and self-perceived health. To study this	 we first investigated whether the amount of green space in the living environment is related to the level of physical activity. When an association between green space and physical activity was found	 we analysed whether this could explain the relationship between green space and health.											
AB The closer link between ports and supply chain leads to a growing research area - port hinterland intermodal development. Focusing on the literature with mathematical models	 the purpose of this paper is to categorise and analyse earlier research contributions on intermodal container flow optimisation	 to identify the research trends and gaps	 and to suggest future research directions. Results show that future research should focus on global intermodal container flow optimisation	 addressing the approaches of ports integrating into such global intermodal chain taken green issues into account. There is substantial need for research addressing greening the intermodal network and sustainable development. Providing cost effective solutions alone in optimisation problem is rather traditional and one-sided. Those market players possessing commercially viable capabilities and also environmental responsibilities would gain a competitive advantage in future dynamic business environment. Bi-objective or multi-objective optimisation would be more suitable to actual situations.												
AB High competition on the international casting market and customers requirements concerning the casts quality forced foundries to keep introducing more advanced technological	 economical and ecological solutions. IT solutions have recently become their integral part. They are usually related to such areas like information flow and logistics. Computer systems allow to define and create processes databases	 update data	 to follow parameters affecting the quality and use collected data to control current quality.													
AB To investigate the association between green tea consumption and the risk of endometrial cancer restricted to endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEA) using a case-control design in Japan.																
AB In response to increasing worldwide awareness of the importance of business sustainability	 there have been more and more environmental regulations enforced in the last decade for example	" waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)"" and the ""restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS). Those regulations have enormous impact on global supply chain systems and have begun to force companies to implement green supply chain management (GSCM). More specifically"	 firms must collaborate with their supply chain partners to improve their environmental management. This study examines the moderating effects of total quality environmental management (TQEM) on the relationship between GSCM and environmental performance (EP). The research premise is that total organizational effort from top management and employees facilitate the implementation of GSCM	 which ultimately enhances green performance. The statistical results indicate that the interactions of GSCM and TQEM enhance environmental performance. Specifically	 firms that implement GSCM practices and simultaneously adopt TQEM perform better in all aspects of environmental management. Several managerial implications are presented with suggestions for future research.											
AB This paper develops hypotheses on the effects of various attitudinal and perceptual variables as well as socio-demographic characteristics of residential electricity customers on an individual's willingness to pay a mark-up for electricity generated from renewable energy sources compared with the price due for electricity from conventional sources. The hypotheses are tested with data from a standardized telephone survey of 238 household electricity consumers in Germany. 53.4% of the participants are willing to pay a mark-up for green electricity. 26.1% report a price tolerance equal to a 5-10% increase in their current electricity bill. Binary logistic and ordinal regression analyses indicate that price tolerance for green electricity is particularly influenced by attitudes (1) towards environmental issues and (2) towards one's current power supplier	 (3) perceptions of the evaluation of green energy by an individual's social reference groups	 (4) household size and (5) current electricity bill level. The findings are used to derive suggestions for energy related informational activities of public institutions	 green marketing strategies of energy companies and future consumer research regarding demand for pro-environmental goods.

AB The effect of green/red asymmetry is studied for the single-car traffic model proposed in [B.A. Toledo	 V. Munoz	 J. Rogan	 C. Tenreiro	 J.A. Valdivia	 Modeling traffic through a sequence of traffic lights	 Phys. Rev. E 70 (1) (2004) 016107]	 on two different signal synchronization strategies	 namely	 all signals in phase	 and a green wave. The asymmetry is characterized by the parameter g = t(gr)/T	 where t(gr) is the green time and T the signal period. Although the car dynamics turns simpler or more complex	 as compared with the equivalent situation for the symmetric case g = 0.5	 critical behavior around resonance is shown to be preserved. However	 unlike the case g = 0.5	 critical exponents at both sides of the resonance are not equal and depend on g. Analytical expressions for them are found	 and shown to be both consistent with simulation results and independent of the distribution of distances between. signals for the green wave case. Also
AB Purpose - Sustainability and the search for solutions that are both efficient and ecologically sound (eco-efficient) have become topics of great interest. However	 companies seeking to develop supply chain solutions that are eco-efficient are often hampered by their ability to control the wider supply chain and they may need to draw on external support from logistics service providers (LSPs). This paper aims to explore the innovative strategies undertaken by LSPs in the eco-efficiency arena and the logistics and learning capabilities needed to achieve eco-efficiency in supply chains.															
AB Today's growth in the level of traffic in cities is leading to both congestion and environmental pollution (exhaust emissions and noise)	 as well as increased costs. Traffic congestion makes cities less pleasant places to live in	 a particular problem being the negative impact on health as a result of increased exhaust emissions. In addition to these emissions	 another major effect of transport which can lead to serious health problems is noise (EEA	 2013a	" 2013b). There is a strong tendency in the world towards the development of ""clean"" motor vehicles that do not pollute the environment"	 that is	 that do not emit harmful substances in their exhaust fumes and which create less noise without causing other types of pollution. The growth in the influence of transport on the environment has resulted in planners formulating procedures which take into account the effect of traffic on the quality of life in urban areas. This paper presents a model for the routing of light delivery vehicles by logistics operators. The model presented takes into account the fact that logistics operators have a limited number of environmentally friendly vehicles (EFV) available to them. When defining a route	 EFV vehicles and environmentally unfriendly vehicles (EUV) are considered separately. For solving the problem of routing in the model	 an adaptive neural network was used which was trained by a simulated annealing algorithm. An adaptive neural network was used for assessing the performance of the network branches. The input parameters of the neural network were the logistics operating costs and environmental parameters (exhaust emissions and noise) for the given vehicle route. Each of the input parameters of the neural network was thoroughly examined. The input parameters were broken down into elements which further describe the state of the environment	 noise and logistics operating costs. After obtaining the performance of the network links for calculating the route for EFV and EUV vehicles a modified Clark-Wright algorithm was used. The proposed model was tested on a network which simulates the conditions in the very centre of Belgrade. All of the input parameters of the model were obtained on the basis of 40 automatic measuring stations for monitoring the air quality (SEA	 2012). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.					
AB This paper demonstrates that a proper design of environmental-regulation pricing strategies is able to promote Extended Product Responsibility for green supply chain firms in a competitive market. A differential game model comprising Vidale-Wolfe equation has been established in light of sales competition and recycling dynamics as well as regulation related profit function. Analytic solutions of Markovian Nash equilibriums are provided with the necessary condition derived from Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We found that governments should opt to gradually raise regulation standards so that rational manufacturers will gradually improve its product recyclability	 and	 in turn	 Extended Product Responsibility will get promoted.

AB The aim of the present study was to test in vivo the effectiveness of an experimental green tea extract in reducing levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva by means of selective culture medium. Sixty-six healthy patients ranging in age from 12 to 18 years were recruited and randomly divided into two groups: Group A (n = 33) and group B (n = 33). Group A subjects were asked to rinse their mouths with 40mL of an experimental green tea extract	 for 1 minute	 three times a day for a week	 whereas Group B subjects were asked to rinse with 40mL of a placebo mouth rinse. Saliva samples were obtained at baseline	 4 days	 and 7 days. The counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were investigated by chair-side kits. Data were statistically processed. A regression binary logistic analysis was done. The statistical significance level was established at P<.05. The experimental group showed a statistically significant reduction in colony counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli relative to the control group. These findings showed the efficacy of a green tea extract against cariogenic oral flora	 opening a promising avenue of clinical applications in the preparation of specific and natural anticariogenic remedies.										
AB Environmental issues are becoming more important in business. However	 applying past models such as the life-cycle model in businesses aiming to take an environmental approach is not always the most successful due to the models only taking a single actor perspective. The current article investigates the value of taking a multi-actor perspective in logistics to improve companies' green credentials. The study discusses various elements required to take a multi-actor approach	 including the balance within the network and the interactions between the actors. The approach needs theoretical development to enable companies to move from a multi-actor eco-efficient approach to a sustainable approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.														
AB Environmental impacts	 such as GHC emissions	 have been introduced to supply chain management as an additional parameter to traditional cost	 lead-time and on-time delivery. Supply chain management represents a significant source of decisions affecting the eco-efficiency of many products. This paper analyses cases from the food industry	 mainly order-picking	 transportation	 warehousing	 and distribution aspects from the greening point of view. Three case examples of decisions in supply chain design in the food industry are considered. The results show dependencies between performance measures. Finally	 a framework of decisions and their impact on performance is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.								
AB Green corridors are a European concept denoting long-distance freight transport corridors where advanced technology and co-modality are used to achieve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Green corridors consider all types of agents acting in the door-to-door co-modality chains	 including ports. Carbon footprints (CF) provide companies	 customers and other agents with information related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the supply chain of products	 identifying key points	 potential risks and opportunities for improvement. Its application in both the logistic networks and all modes of transport would allow for the creation of green corridors and sustainable motorways of the sea. This paper describes the method which is composed of financial accounts (MC3) used to estimate the CF of a port. It shows the effects of the method on the Port of Gijon (PAG)	 which steers the existing Gijon/Nantes/Saint-Nazaire motorway of the sea. The extension of the system to all nodes of the shipping line and other transport modes will lead in the long run to a carbon-neutral green corridor. Our findings show the importance of looking at indirect emissions in order to become a carbon neutral port.											
AB Stay-green plants retain green leaves longer after anthesis and can have improved yield	 particularly under water limitation. As senescence is a dynamic process	 genotypes with different senescence patterns may exhibit similar final normalised difference vegetative index (NDVI). By monitoring NDVI from as early as awn emergence to maturity	 we demonstrate that analysing senescence dynamics improves insight into genotypic stay-green variation. A senescence evaluation tool was developed to fit a logistic function to NDVI data and used to analyse data from three environments for a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) population whose lines contrast for stay-green. Key stay-green traits were estimated including	 maximum NDVI	 senescence rate and a trait integrating NDVI variation after anthesis	 as well as the timing from anthesis to onset	 midpoint and conclusion of senescence. The integrative trait and the timing to onset and mid-senescence exhibited high positive correlations with yield and a high heritability in the three studied environments. Senescence rate was correlated with yield in some environments	 whereas maximum NDVI was associated with yield in a drought-stressed environment. Where resources preclude frequent measurements	 we found that NDVI measurements may be restricted to the period of rapid senescence	 but caution is required when dealing with lines of different phenology. In contrast	 regular monitoring during the whole period after flowering allows the estimation of senescence dynamics traits that may be reliably compared across genotypes and environments. We anticipate that selection for stay-green traits will enhance genetic progress towards high-yielding	 stay-green germplasm.				
AB In 1999	 the Chinese government initiated a massive conservation programme	 the 'Grain-for-Green' programme	 to reduce soil erosion and to improve the eco-environmental status in western China through the set-aside of sloping agricultural lands and their conversion to forest and pasture. The attitudes and perceptions of farmers towards Grain-for-Green are little known	 but will eventually dictate the direction and	 ultimately	 the success of the project. This paper interprets surveys concerning attitudes towards environmental protection	 in general	 and the Grain-for-Green programme	 in particular	 in two small catchments in the Loess hilly area. Participatory Rural Assessment techniques are used as survey instruments and logistic regression analysis is used to analyze farmers' attitudes towards environmental conservation and Grain-for-Green. Most respondents are positive about environmental protection and Grain-for-Green in general. However	 marked differences are evident between the two small catchments: the level of farmers' environmental protection consciousness in Anjiapo catchment is higher than that in Danangou catchment. Respondents in Anjiapo catchment expressed more support for the programme than respondents in Danangou catchment. Environmental care by farmers may not be sustainable should the programme come to an end. The results provide a useful insight into the interests and concerns of farmers	 which might lead to a more positive attitude in officials in the future.				
AB Due to an increased awareness and significant environmental pressures from various stakeholders	 companies have begun to realize the significance of incorporating green practices into their daily activities. This paper proposes a framework using Fuzzy TOPSIS to select green suppliers for a Brazilian electronics company; our framework is built on the criteria of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. An empirical analysis is made	 and the data are collected from a set of 12 available suppliers. We use a fuzzy TOPSIS approach to rank the suppliers	 and the results of the proposed framework are compared with the ranks obtained by both the geometric mean and the graded mean methods of fuzzy TOPSIS methodology. Then a Spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to find the statistical difference between the ranks obtained by the three methods. Finally	 a sensitivity analysis has been performed to examine the influence of the preferences given by the decision makers for the chosen GSCM practices on the selection of green suppliers. Results indicate that the four dominant criteria are Commitment of senior management to GSCM; Product designs that reduce	 reuse	 recycle	 or reclaim materials	 components	 or energy; Compliance with legal environmental requirements and auditing programs; and Product designs that avoid or reduce toxic or hazardous material use.

AB There are inherent limitations to inferring green turtle (Chelonia mydas L.) diving behavior from time-depth recorders (TDRs). Validating TDR data with independent observations of turtle behaviors is imperative to derive behavioral inferences from these archival data. Logistic regressions of video observational data and corresponding TDR data from six juvenile green turtles at the Kawai'nui Marsh Estuary (KME) in Kailua Bay	 O'ahu	 Hawai'i	 were used to determine the extent to which TDR records capture six specific behaviors recorded using a submersible video camera. While foraging	 food searching	 hovering	 and breathing could be explained using a combination of TDR-derived metrics	 the records could not describe swimming and resting. The habitat associations of turtle activity patterns (activities) were also evaluated	 with some behaviors being more commonly encountered in specific habitat types	 including resting and breathing. Comparison of video-recorded in situ observations of juvenile green turtles to concurrent TDR records indicated that TDR data alone can accurately describe certain turtle behaviors at KME	 but are insufficient to describe a turtle's full range of behavior. Therefore	 we contend that direct behavioral observations augment TDR deployments by ensuring the full behavioral repertoire of juvenile green turtles is captured. The integration of these disparate datasets can enhance the understanding of juvenile green turtle behaviors	 especially within shallow heterogeneous habitats like the Kawai'nui Marsh Estuary.

AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) has gained increasing attention within both academia and industry. As the literature grows	 finding new directions by critically evaluating the research and identifying future directions becomes important in advancing knowledge for the field. Using organizational theories to help categorize the literature provides opportunities to address both the objectives of understanding where the field currently stands and identifying research opportunities and directions. After providing a background discussion on GSCM	 we categorize and review recent GSCM literature under nine broad organizational theories	 with a special emphasis on investigation of adoption	 diffusion and outcomes of GSCM practices. Within this review framework	 we also identify GSCM research questions that are worthy of investigation. Additional organizational theories which are considered valuable for future GSCM research are also identified with a conclusion for this review. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the diffusion of ISO 14001-based environmental management system (EMS) on five key organisational functions	 namely production	 procurement	 sales	 logistics	 and R&D. In examining the EMS diffusion	 this paper focuses on two aspects of diffusion: the extent of diffusion of EMS and the balance of EMS diffusion across the five organisational functions.										
AB Under third-party power intervention (TPPI)	 which increases uncertainty in task environments	 complex channel power interplays and restructuring are indispensable among green supply chain members as they move toward sustainable collaborative relationships for increased viability and competitive advantage. From the resource dependence perspective	 this work presents a novel conceptual model to investigate the influence of political and social power on channel power restructuring and induced green supply chain collaboration in brander-retailer bidirectional green supply chains of fashionable consumer electronics products (FCEPs). An FCEP refers to the consumer electronics product (e.g.	 personal computers	 mobile phones	 computer notebooks	 and game consoles) with the features of a well-known brand associated	 a short product lifecycle	 timely and fashionable design fit for market trends	 and quick responsiveness to the variations of market demands. The proposed model is tested empirically using questionnaire data obtained from retailers in the FCEP brander-retailer distribution channels. Analytical results reveal that as an extension of political and social power	 TPPI positively affects the reciprocal interdependence of dyadic members and reduces power asymmetry	 thereby enhancing the collaborative relationship of dyadic members and leading to improved green supply chain performance. Therein	 reciprocal interdependence underlying collaborative relationship is the key to reducing the external environmental uncertainties in the TPPI context.

AB The Caribbean accommodations sector has embarked on a course of 'greening' or instituting environmental management (EM). In order to further explore this EM movement	 this study sought to examine motives	 facilitators	 and constraints to implementing EM based on diffusion of innovations theory. Data were collected through an online survey of 197 hotels in 19 countries. Two-thirds of the accommodations sector had implemented some level of EM from basic initiatives to certified environmental management systems. Descriptive and statistical analysis were employed to understand motives	 facilitators	 and constraints to implementing EM. Based on logistic analysis	 a single motive item	 internal green champion was significantly associated with level of environmental management implemented	 while none of the facilitator items were statistically significant. However	 several constraints such as lack of capital	 potential benefits not apparent	 no access to technology	 lack of know-how	 EM is not necessary and	 lack of time were all predictors of EM. Based on the results	 several recommendations were made to strengthen the greening efforts in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
AB Increasingly	" the debate on freight transport and logistics involves the challenge of sustainable development. Key objectives of sustainable or ""green"" freight logistics systems are the mitigation of negative environmental and human health effects of distribution operations and the realization of a major modal shift in transport preferences"	 while at the same time achieving internal generalized cost efficiency and quality of services. Pursuing these goals requires the introduction of a range of measures. These measures call for private and public actors to take up various initiatives and adopt policies. Usually	 it is more effective to combine different actions into an integrated package of measures than to introduce single instruments in isolation.													
AB Citrus greening	 also known as Huanglongbing or HLB	 is a major threat to the U.S. citrus industry. Currently	 scouting and visual inspection are used for screening infected trees. However	 this is a time-consuming and expensive method for HLB disease detection. Moreover	 as it is subjective	 the current method exhibits high detection error rates. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy for identifying HLB-infected citrus trees. The spectral data from infected and healthy orange trees of the Valencia variety were collected from four different orchards in Florida. Two different spectroradiometers with a spectral range of 350 to 2500 nm were used to collect the canopy reflectance spectral data. Three classification techniques were used to classify the data: k-nearest neighbors (KNN)	 logistic regression (LR)	 and support vector machines (SVM). Analysis showed that using only one canopy reflectance observation per tree was inadequate. None of the classification methods was successful in discriminating healthy trees from HLB-infected trees because of the large variability in the canopy reflectance spectral data. When five spectra from the same tree were used for classification	 the SVM and weighted KNN methods classified spectra with 3.0% and 6.5% error rates	 respectively The results from this study indicate that canopy VIS-NIR spectral reflectance data can be used to detect HLB-infected citrus trees; however	 high classification accuracy (>90%) requires multiple measurements from a single tree.					
AB Background: Tea is the most common consumed drink in the world after water. Green tea is used mainly in EastAsian countries. Previous studies have shown its benefits on cardiovascular diseases.																
AB The direct and indirect effect of ICT on energy conservation and emission reduction is described. The energy consumption per unit GDP in the ICT industry is lower than that in other industries. The application of ICT in such fields as industrial design	 manufacturing	 management	 logistics	 sales and service can be helpful for energy conservation and emission reduction in the industrial and transportations industry; however	 the issue of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by voluminous deployment of ICT products should never be overlooked. This paper presents the latest development of communications products in energy conservation and exemplifies the roles of ICT in energy conservation and consumption reduction. The issue of electromagnetic radiation of ICT products and the recycling and reuse of e-wastes are explored.											
AB The profitability of remanufacturing systems for different cost	 technology	 and logistics structures has been extensively investigated in the literature. We provide an alternative and somewhat complementary approach that considers demand-related issues	 such as the existence of green segments	 original equipment manufacturer competition	 and product life-cycle effects. The profitability of a remanufacturing system strongly depends on these issues as well as on their interactions. For a monopolist	 we show that there exist thresholds on the remanufacturing cost savings	 the green segment size	 market growth rate	 and consumer valuations for the remanufactured products	 above which remanufacturing is profitable. More important	 we show that under competition remanufacturing can become an effective marketing strategy	 which allows the manufacturer to defend its market share via price discrimination.				
AB Understanding eco-industrial park formation requires a multidisciplinary viewpoint [Haskins	 Syst Eng 9 (2006b)] that includes systems thinking	 industrial ecology	 organizational dynamics	 logistics	 and supply chain theory. The most often referenced eco-industrial park found in Kalundborg	 Denmark	 serves as an ideal	 and is typified by tight interdependency between industrial partners	 green logistics	 and closed-loop supply chains. But the planet is in crisis [Atiyah and Press	 joint statement from The Royal Society and the Hational Academy of Sciences on Population Growth and Sustainability	 February 1992] and cannot afford to wait 30 years for more of these parks to emerge. Systems engineering has been found to be effective when bringing together stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and experts from multidisciplinary engineering and technical backgrounds to coordinate the creation of complex systems. This paper uses literature drawn from multidisciplinary sources to investigate the attributes of eco-industrial parks	 and then proposes a systems engineering framework	 iFACE	 for the formation of eco-industrial parks.

AB Microspore culture is used to generate completely homozygous plants in a single generation	 thereby reducing cost and time required for the production of doubled haploid (DH) plants for breeding and genetic studies. Many factors are known to influence green plant recovery including composition of regeneration media	 donor plant genotype	 microspore developmental stage	 and pretreatment conditions. The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop an improved regeneration medium for wheat microspore culture and (ii) determine the optimal pretreatment conditions and regeneration media combination for increasing green plant recovery rates. Four wheat cultivars	 two pretreatment methods (0.4 M mannitol at 4 C and solution B containing 0.3 M mannitol with inorganic components at room temperature)	 and five regeneration media were tested. Green plant recovery rates from each treatment combination were analyzed using the Proc Logistic model in SAS. Regeneration medium fortified with ascorbic acid produced the highest number of green plants across the different pretreatment conditions	 regeneration media	 and cultivars tested. Pretreating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spikes with 0.4 M mannitol at 4 C followed by embryoid induction and regeneration in a medium fortified with ascorbic acid resulted in the recovery of the highest number of green plants. This high-efficiency method may prove useful for producing DH populations for wheat improvement efforts.								
AB Purpose - This research aims to design a green pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) that reduces preventable pharmaceutical waste and effectively disposes of inevitable pharmaceutical waste.

AB Aims:To assess the relationship between green space proximity	 use of green space and depressive symptoms and perceived general health among a random sample men and women. Methods: Cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 6	944 45-72 year old Kaunas city residents. Self-reported questionnaires provided information on sociodemographic variables	 health behaviours	 depressive symptoms and poor and very poor perceived general health. Residential proximity to green spaces was defined as living less than 300 m	 within interval of 300-999 m	 and equal or more than 1 km from a park. The use of the park was divided into two categories: no park use or use <4hrs/week and use of the park 4 h/week. The study received approval from the Kaunas Regional Research Ethics Committee. Multiple logistic regression assessed the associations controlling for confounding variables. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms and poor and or very poor perceived general health was higher in women than in men. The association between the use of the park and residential proximity to the park revealed that women living >300 m from a green space and who used the space 4 h/week showed higher odds 1.92 (1.11-3.3) and 1.68 (0.81-3.48) of depressive symptoms and poor and very poor perceived general health as compared to those who used the park <4 hrs/week and residential proximity was >300 m. Conclusions: The results of our study confirmed an association between use of the green space	 residential proximity	 and depressive symptoms and poor and very poor perceived general health among women only.								
AB This paper addresses the planning of recyclable waste collection systems while accounting for economic and environmental concerns. Service areas and vehicle routes are defined for logistics networks with multiple depots where different products are collected. The problem is modeled as a multi-product	 multi-depot vehicle routing problem with two objective functions: distance and CO2 emissions minimization. A decomposition solution method is developed and applied to a real case study. Six scenarios regarding different service areas and objective functions are studied. Savings of up to 22% in distance and 27% in CO2 emissions are achieved	 exceeding economic and environmental goals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the relation of tea consumption with the risk of oral cancer incidence.																
AB Background: Green tea	 a popular beverage in Japan	 contains many polyphenolic antioxidants	 which might prevent cardiovascular disease. This study is designed to determine whether the consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a case-control study. Methods: Incident SAH cases (n=201) were identified and individually matched by age (+/- 2 years) and gender to hospital (n=201) and community controls (n=201) from April 1992 to March 1997. Habitual regular tea consumption was assessed with a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios adjusted for smoking	 history of hypertension	 and educational levels. Results: The proportion of the consumption of one time or more of tea per day was higher in controls (70.9%) than in SAH patients (60.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that green tea consumption was inversely associated with SAH risk. Subjects consuming < 1	 and >= 1 time per day had adjusted ORs of 0.74 (CI: 0.34-1.58)	 and 0.56 (CI: 0.32-0.98) in comparison with non daily green tea drinkers	 respectively (p-trend < 0.001). Conclusion: In a case-control study in Japan	 we found that habitual green tea consumption may be strongly associated with a reduced risk for SAH. Our findings will be useful in targeting individuals and populations for the primary prevention of SAH.							
AB The main purpose of this study was to develop a set of measures for evaluating the performance of the automobile green supply chain. This study reviewed various literatures on green supply chain performance measurement	 environmental management	 traditional supply chain performance measurement	 and automobile supply chain management. In order to comprehensively and effectively establish the relevant measures	 a suitable framework which considered the automobile green supply chain as a two-in-one chain was adopted. This two-in-one chain comprised a forward and backward chain for the automobile industry. Consequently	 10 measures with 49 metrics and 6 measures with 23 metrics were identified and developed for the forward and backward chains	 respectively. Sequel to the development of these measures	 a survey was conducted using a four-page questionnaire distributed to experts (including academics and practitioners) to establish their importance and applicability. The findings of this study suggested that the importance and applicability of all the developed measures have been substantiated. For the forward chain	 the most crucial measure was customer perspective while the most applicable one was traditional supply chain cost. The reverse chain measures were topped by management commitment in terms of both importance and applicability. This study contributed to the advancement of knowledge by pioneering the development of a set of holistic measures for evaluating the performance of the automobile green supply chain. The study was wrapped up with the proposition of directions for further studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.								
AB The aim of this work was to determine the growth curve of the fruit mass and the longitudinal and transversal diameter	 as well as the accumulation of solid and liquid albumens (coconut water) and its sensorial characterization in different stages. Fruitages of green dwarf coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.) were evaluated fortnightly in 26 times during the period of their formation	 from April 2004 to May 2005	 in the city of Bebedouro	 Sao Paulo state. Models of logistics regression and logistics with quadratic exponential were applied to the data with the graphic collaboration of the growth curves	 obtaining a high level of agreements for the evaluated parameter. The longitudinal external diameter reached 20	12 centimeters in its 375 days after the opening of the inflorescence (d.a.o.i.) and to the transversal external diameter 14	57 centimeters in its 345 (d.a.o.i.). The fruitages reached bigger mass in the period between 255 and 315 days after the opening of inflorescence	 and there was no significant statistic difference in this period. The solid albumen had an initial formation in its 225 days after the opening of inflorescence	 reaching the mass of 214.78 grams in its 375 days. The biggest liquid albumen volume was verified in 8 1/2 month-old fruit	 combining with the adequate taste	" by sensorial evaluation of the fruitage water for its consume ""in nature"""	 pointing it as important indicatives for the ideal point of the fruitage harvest in this period in the city of Bebedouro	 Sao Paulo state.			
AB Despite the vast amount of research on threatened and endangered green turtle populations	 some uncertainty regarding stage durations	 growth rates	 and age at maturation remains. We used skeletochronology to address this gap in knowledge for green turtle populations in the North Atlantic Ocean that use coastal waters along the southeastern U.S. as developmental habitat. Oceanic stage duration was estimated at 1-7 years ((X) over bar = 3 years). Several growth models	 including von Bertalanffy	 logistic	 Gompertz	 and power functions were evaluated for describing sex-specific length-at-age data. Ages at maturation estimated using mean size at nesting for females from each genetic sub-population contributing juveniles to this neritic foraging area were 44 years (Florida)	 42.5 years (Costa Rica)	 and 42 years (Mexico)	 which were higher than previously reported ages. This implies that nesting populations comprising primarily individuals utilizing foraging grounds in the southeastern U.S. may take longer to recover than previously estimated.						
AB This article explores the reasons that affect the decisions of managers of firms to adopt management practices in order to green their supply chain management. Under the context of environmental policy	 the relationship between policy instruments ('command and control'	 market-based	 and self-regulated) and the decisions of managers to adopt green supply chain management (G-SCM) practices is examined. The results show that in some cases the environmental legislation	 market-based instruments and self-regulated incentives could play a critical role in the decisions of managers to adopt some specific G-SCM practices	 while in other cases environmental policy instruments have not seemed to affect the decisions of managers regarding some other G-SCM practices.											
AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of masticatory ability and dental status with intake of fruits and vegetables after adjusting for other factors in independently living elderly Japanese subjects. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 1	535 community-dwelling	 independent elderly subjects over the age of 60 years. Self-assessed general health	 financial status	 dental status	 self-assessed masticatory ability by food acceptance	 and frequency of food intake were evaluated from responses to a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis for shortage of food intake was carried out. Results: Of the participants	 29% had natural dentitions in both the maxilla and mandible and 15% were edentulous in at least one arch and wearing a complete denture. Percentages of participants with nutrient shortages of meat	 fish and seafood	 green and yellow vegetables	 other vegetables	 and fruits were 44%	 17%	 30%	 33%	 and 12%	 respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that men and subjects with a poor financial status had significant associations with shortages of dietary intake. In addition
AB Associations of coffee	 tea	 and other caffeinated beverages with ovarian cancer risk remain uncertain. In a population-based study in Washington State	 781 women with epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed in 2002 to 2005 and 1	263 controls completed self-administered questionnaires detailing consumption of caffeinated and noncaffeinated coffee	 teas	 and colas and in-person interviews regarding reproductive and hormonal exposures. We assessed risk associated with coffee	 tea	 and cola drinking and with total caffeine consumption using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Neither caffeinated nor decaffeinated coffees were associated with ovarian cancer risk; also	 we observed no association of total caffeine with risk using a combined index that summed intake from coffee	 tea	 and carbonated soft drinks. Among teas	 neither herbal/decaffeinated nor black teas were associated with risk; however	 women who reported drinking l cup/d of green tea had a 54% reduction in risk (P-trend = 0.01). Associations of green tea with risk were similar when invasive and borderline cases were considered separately and when Asian women were excluded from analysis. Green tea	 which is commonly consumed in countries with low ovarian cancer incidence	 should be further investigated for its cancer prevention properties.	
AB This study aims to utilize the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to recognize the influential criteria of carbon management in green supply chain for improving the overall performance of suppliers in terms of carbon management. Thirteen criteria of carbon management with three dimensions were identified from literature review and interview with three experts at an electronics manufacturer. By considering the interrelationships among the criteria	 DEMATEL was applied to deal with the importance and causal relationships among the evaluation criteria of supplier selection. Obtained results show that the criteria of management systems of carbon information and training related to carbon management are revealed to be the top two significant influences in selecting suppliers with carbon management competencies. By identifying the structures and interrelationships	 it can offer an insight for managers to understand cause-effort relationships and allow to select suppliers who are capable of having competence in carbon management and to improve suppliers' performance.

AB This study aims to investigate the elements of green management practices (GMP) and its association with firm performance. A GMP model that consists of the key elements of GMP is proposed and firm performance indicators are formulated to provide a foundation for the adoption of GMP. Hutchison Port Holding (HPH) is selected as the case to illustrate the application of the proposed GMP model in a real-life situation. The findings suggest that GMP consists of the following elements: (1) cooperation with supply chain partners	 (2) environmentally friendly operation	 and (3) internal management support. Findings of this study also indicate a positive relationship exists between the adoption of GMP and firm performance. Hence	 operators in the container terminal industry should strive to adopt GMP in order to achieve good firm performance including improvement in terminal throughput	 profitability	 and efficient and cost-effective operation.

AB It has been noted in the past that economically sound	 environmentally preferable life extension modes such as remanufacturing and recycling have special characteristics that complicate the management of their production	 logistics and associated operations. This paper considers these complicating characteristics from the perspective of the nine different modes of product life extension. In doing so	 a framework and guide is provided to what issues	 resource requirements and management capabilities are required for specific life extension modes. This framework provides guidance to practitioners and academics on commonalities between different product life extension modes	 thereby assisting practitioners in leveraging current internal skills and capabilities and researchers in determining the generalizability of research.											
AB The purpose of this paper is to delineate a green supply chain (GSC) performance measurement framework using an intra-organisational collaborative decision-making (CDM) approach. A fuzzy analytic network process (ANP)-based green-balanced scorecard (GrBSc) has been used within the CDM approach to assist in arriving at a consistent	 accurate and timely data flow across all cross-functional areas of a business. A green causal relationship is established and linked to the fuzzy ANP approach. The causal relationship involves organisational commitment	 eco-design	 GSC process	 social performance and sustainable performance constructs. Sub-constructs and sub-sub-constructs are also identified and linked to the causal relationship to form a network. The fuzzy ANP approach suitably handles the vagueness of the linguistics information of the CDM approach. The CDM approach is implemented in a UK-based carpet-manufacturing firm. The performance measurement approach	 in addition to the traditional financial performance and accounting measures	 aids in firm's decision-making with regard to the overall organisational goals. The implemented approach assists the firm in identifying further requirements of the collaborative data across the supply-cain and information about customers and markets. Overall	 the CDM-based GrBSc approach assists managers in deciding if the suppliers' performances meet the industry and environment standards with effective human resource.									
AB The design of container shipping networks is an important logistics problem	 involving assets and operational costs measured in billions of dollars. To guide the optimal deployment of the ships	 a single vessel round trip is considered by minimizing operational costs and flowing the best paying demand under commercially driven constraints. This paper introduces the Single Liner Shipping Service Design Problem. Arc-flow and path-flow models are presented using state-of-the-art elements from the wide literature on pickup and delivery problems. A Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm is proposed	 and implementation details are discussed. The algorithm can solve instances with up to 25 ports to optimality	 a very promising result as real-world vessel roundtrips seldom involve more than 20 ports. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Changes in shipping over recent decades have altered the geography of freight transportation in the USA in a number of ways. In particular significant volumes of freight traffic are now traveling inland to the Ohio River valley and the Midwest. Within metropolitan areas here	 large amounts of land on the suburban fringe are being developed as logistics or distribution centers in municipalities that are experiencing otherwise typical green field suburban growth. This article explores this development through a case study in the southwest suburbs of Chicago that are experiencing rapid growth in both population and freight distribution activity. Here	 in a so-called global era of placeless flows	 land use and economic development continue to be based largely on a spatial imaginary of bounded and discrete territories	 with long-term environmental and economic consequences for the political units in question.												
AB The interaction between product innovation and companies' activities aimed at improving the energy efficiency of production facilities has been relatively little studied	 but is of great relevance to society and companies given the strong focus of governments on grand challenges like climate change	 green innovation technologies	 and environmental problems in general. This paper utilizes the 2009 European Manufacturing Survey for the Danish sub-sample including 335 manufacturing firms. Through factor analysis	 this paper confirms three main areas of focus of new product development: efficiency considerations	 market attention	 and greening of innovation. Logistic regression analysis demonstrates that while market attention is important for the development of new products	 green aspects of innovation and efficiency considerations are important for production companies wanting to improve their energy efficiency. When these models are combined	 the results highlight that energy efficiency moderates the effect of market attention to new product development. This paper therefore finds that aligning product innovation and energy efficiency is a complex and intertwined process - focusing on one may have indirect detrimental effects on the other. These results point to the conclusion that researchers and practitioners in innovation management have to consider more carefully the specificities and interactions of different types of products and process innovations and their environmental implications	 and must formulate new	 more sustainable managerial practices combining energy efficiency and product innovation.

AB During the last decades there has been a consistent need for companies to manufacture 'green' products in order to contribute to environmental protection. The utilisation of used products (literally	 the extension of their useful life cycle) is an excellent	 indirect way for companies to conform to this requirement and	 at the same time	 increase their profit. In this paper a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model is proposed	 which can be used for the optimisation of procurement	 remanufacturing	 stocking and salvaging decisions. The model is flexible enough to incorporate multiple suppliers	 several quality levels of returned products and multiple periods of time. The applicability of the model is demonstrated through the optimisation of alternative scenarios	 the optimal solutions of which reveal the potential profitability of used products exploitation.							
AB Accurately modeling the land surface phenology based on satellite data is very important to the study of vegetation ecological dynamics and the related ecosystem process. In this study	 we developed a Sigmoid curve (S-curve) function by integrating an asymmetric Gaussian function and a logistic function to fit the leaf area index (LAI) curve. We applied the resulting asymptotic lines and the curvature extrema to derive the vegetation phenophases of germination	 green-up	 maturity	 senescence	 defoliation and dormancy. The new proposed S-curve function has been tested in a specific area (Shangdong Province	 China)	 characterized by a specific pattern in leaf area index (LAI) time course due to the dominant presence of crops. The function has not yet received any global testing. The identified phenophases were validated against measurement stations in Shandong Province. (i) From the site-scale comparison	 we find that the detected phenophases using the S-curve (SC) algorithm are more consistent with the observations than using the logistic (LC) algorithm and the asymmetric Gaussian (AG) algorithm	 especially for the germination and dormancy. The phenological recognition rates (PRRs) of the SC algorithm are obviously higher than those of two other algorithms. The S-curve function fits the LAI curve much better than the logistic function and asymmetric Gaussian function; (ii) The retrieval results of the SC algorithm are reliable and in close proximity to the green-up observed data whether using the AVHRR LAI or the improved MODIS LAI. Three inversion algorithms shows the retrieval results based on AVHRR LAI are all later than based on improved MODIS LAI. The bias statistics reveal that the retrieval results based on the AVHRR LAI datasets are more reasonable than based on the improved MODIS LAI datasets. Overall	 the S-curve algorithm has the advantage of deriving vegetation phenophases across time and space as compared to the LC algorithm and the AG algorithm. With the SC algorithm	 the vegetation phenophases can be extracted more effectively.					
AB We review the literature on sustainable supply chains during the last decade; 2000-2010. We analyze the literature from different perspectives. We then provide frameworks for sustainable supply chain management and performance measures. We also provide a case study to illustrate the experience of a utility supply chain in setting performance indicators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																
AB Companies interested in greening their supply chains quickly realize that carbon and energy waste represents an expense	 and thus minimizing this expense not only brings in truckloads of money	 but also helps save the environment. This paper demonstrates that shipment consolidation	 a powerful logistics strategy that combines two or more small shipments into an aggregate load to be dispatched on the same vehicle	 can help mitigate carbon and energy waste. Specifically	 a Discrete-Time Based Shipment ConsoLidation (DTB-SCL) policy and a new method to calculate CO2 emissions associated with the dispatch of a vehicle are introduced. In addition	 an optimization model with the objective of maximizing combined economic and environmental savings is developed in this study. It is shown that	 among other benefits	 the higher use of transportation capacity decreases environmental damage	 one goal of the DTB-SCL policy. The mechanics of the mathematical models are illustrated by numerical examples	 and sensitivity analyses are conducted to provide managerial insights that might help companies come to better decisions that are environmentally responsible.

AB Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Tea has anticarcinogenic effects against breast cancer in experimental studies. However	 epidemiologic evidence that tea protects against breast cancer has been inconsistent. A case-control study was conducted in Southeast China between 2004 and 2005. The incidence cases were 1009 female patients aged 20-87 years with histologically confirmed breast cancer. The 1009 age-matched controls were healthy women randomly recruited from breast disease clinics. Information on duration	 frequency	 quantity	 preparation	 type of tea consumption	 diet and lifestyle were collected by face-to-face interview using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals. Compared with non-tea drinkers	 green tea drinkers tended to reside in urban	 have better education and have higher consumption of coffee	 alcohol	 soy	 vegetables and fruits. After adjusting established and potential confounders	 green tea consumption was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The ORs were 0.87 (0.73-1.04) in women consuming 1-249 g of dried green tea leaves per annum	 0.68 (0.54-0.86) for 250-499 g per annum	 0.59 (0.45-0.77) for 500-749 g per annum and 0.61 (0.48-0.78) for >= 750 g per annum	 with a statistically significant test for trend (P < 0.001). Similar dose-response relationships were observed for duration of drinking green tea	 number of cups consumed and new batches prepared per day. We conclude that regular consumption of green tea can protect against breast cancer. More research to closely examine the relationship between tea consumption and breast cancer risk is warranted.
AB Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between proximity to green spaces and surrounding greenness and pregnancy outcomes	 such as birth weight	 low birth weight (LBW)	 very LBW (VLBW)	 gestational age	 preterm deliveries (PTD) and very PTD (VPTD).											
AB With globalization	 especially after China's entry into the WTO	 an increasing number of Chinese firms have experienced social responsibility barriers such that they lose international orders due to failure in meeting the requirements of environment	 human rights or safety standard. This study attempts to shed some light on the mechanism underlying logistics social responsibility (LSR) in China. In particular	 based on the five-dimensional structure of LSR framework	 we propose that clan culture	 business ethics	 pressures from customers	 suppliers	 competitors and law/regulations are important antecedents of five dimensions of LSR. A mail survey was conducted in China and a total of 162 firm-level questionnaires were returned. Structural equation modeling was employed to test our theory. The results support our hypotheses that clan culture and business ethics of a firm have significant impacts on all the five dimensions of LSR. However	 pressures from customers	 suppliers	 competitors and law/regulations only have effects on some dimensions of LSR. The contributions and implications of these findings are discussed further.

AB The results of this study provide empirical insight into factors influencing the early adoption of green electricity by Dutch residential users. Earlier research revealed that early adoption is closely related to social visibility	 which is lacking in the case of green power. This raises the question of which factors influence adoption in the absence of visibility. The contributions of this study are threefold. First	 we used a theoretical perspective in which a cognitive approach was combined with an economic approach leading to a more comprehensive framework. Second	 the empirical focus on residential users of renewable resources is relatively new. Third	 the results of our analyses provide insights into factors influencing early (non-)adoption	 knowledge which could be valuable to market actors and governments stimulating the adoption of sustainable consumer products. For our theoretical framework	 we distinguished three sets of independent variables: factors related to (1) the technical system	 (2) individuals	 and (3) economic issues. Data collection took place among households just I month before the liberalisation of the Dutch green electricity market. creating a unique database of residential (non-)users. Our results show that the proposed extended model is more powerful than partial models. Moreover. our findings suggest that cognitive and economic intentional variables	 as well as variables indicating basic knowledge and actual environmental behaviour in the past	 are strong predictors of the probability of adoption. The paper closes with research-based recommendations for practitioners. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.						
AB Objectives: To determine the prevalence of physical activity advice	 including the Green Prescription (a physical activity scripting scheme)	 given in the primary care setting	 and the characteristics of New Zealanders who receive such advice.													
AB As customers are becoming more environmental conscious and governments are making stricter environmental regulations	 the industries need to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chain. Indian auto component manufacturing industries especially SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are focused to cleaner production by implementing Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in their industries. But they are struggling to implement GSCM concept. The present research analyzes the barriers for the implementation of GSCM concept which has been divided into two phases such as identification of barriers and qualitative analysis. The study has used three different research phases: identification of barriers from the literature	 interviews with various department managers and a survey of auto component manufacturing industries. The identification phase led to the selection of twenty-six barriers based on literature and in consultation with industrial experts and academicians. The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) qualitative analysis was used to understand the mutual influences amongst the twenty-six barriers by survey. This study seeks to identify which barrier is acting as the most dominant one for the adoption of green supply chain management and this result is helpful for industries to make easier the adoption of green concept in their supply chain by removing the dominant barrier. It indicates that different Indian auto component manufacturing industries have differing barriers for the implementation of green supply chain management. However	 in their GSCM implementation	 especially for maintaining the environmental awareness	 the supplier barrier is the dominant one. Finally the approach has been applied to ten auto components manufacturing industries in Tamilnadu	 South India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.										
AB In this paper we investigate the existence of the periodic solutions of a quasilinear differential equation with piecewise constant argument of generalized type. By using some fixed point theorems and some new analysis technique	 sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions of these systems. A new Gronwall type lemma is proved. Some examples concerning biological models as Lasota-Wazewska	 Nicholson's blowflies and logistic models are treated.														
AB Ninety-six nylon pairs were prepared	 including red	 yellow	 green	 and blue standards	 each at two lightness levels with CIE94 Delta E units ranging from 0.15 to 4.01. Visual assessments of acceptability were carried out by 21 females. Logistic regression compared visual results to four color-difference equations	 CIELAB	 CMC	 CIE94	 and CIEDE2000. It was found that CMC most closely represented judgments of average observers. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals	 Inc.						
AB There is a growing need for integrating environmentally sound choices into supply-chain management research and practice. Perusal of the literature shows that a broad frame of reference for green supply-chain management (GrSCM) is not adequately developed. Regulatory bodies that formulate regulations to meet societal and ecological concerns to facilitate growth of business and economy also suffer from its absence. A succinct classification to help academicians	 researchers and practitioners in understanding integrated GrSCM from a wider perspective is needed. Further	 sufficient literature is available to warrant such classification. This paper takes an integrated and fresh look into the area of GrSCM. The literature on GrSCM is covered exhaustively from its conceptualization	 primarily taking a 'reverse logistics angle'. Using the rich body of available literature	 including earlier reviews that had relatively limited perspectives	 the literature on GrSCM is classified on the basis of the problem context in supply chain's major influential areas. It is also classified on the basis of methodology and approach adopted. Various mathematical tools/techniques used in literature vis-a-vis the contexts of GrSCM are mapped.

AB Purpose - A program of shipment consolidation (SCL) is the purposeful intervention by management to regularly combine several small shipments so that a larger load may be dispatched on the same vehicle. SCL decisions traditionally have been based upon minimization of total logistics costs (inventory plus transportation). The paper aims to answer the following research question: given the environmental implications of vehicle emissions as a function of load weight	 are the familiar SCL policies still optimal?															
AB Purpose - Both logisticians and tax lawyers design global supply chains but based on different logics. If they do not align each other's perspectives	 problems might occur in different areas. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the impact the tax system could have on supply chain design	 reflect (from both perspectives) on how the rules function	 and propose a common communication platform for supply chain issues and tax issues.													
AB The most common differential diagnosis of beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) trait is iron deficiency anemia. Several red blood cell equations were introduced during different studies for differential diagnosis between P-thal trait and iron deficiency anemia. Due to genetic variations in different regions	 these equations cannot be useful in all population. The aim of this study was to determine a native equation with high accuracy for differential diagnosis of 0-thal trait and iron deficiency anemia for the Sistan and Baluchestan population by logistic regression analysis. We selected 77 iron deficiency anemia and 100 ii-thal trait cases. We used binary logistic regression analysis and determined best equations for probability prediction of beta-thal trait against iron deficiency anemia in our population. We compared diagnostic values and receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve related to this equation and another 10 published equations in discriminating ii-thal trait and iron deficiency anemia. The binary logistic regression analysis determined the best equation for best probability prediction of P-thal trait against iron deficiency anemia with area under curve (AUC) 0.998. Based on ROC curves and AUC	 Green & King	 England & Frazer	 and then Sirdah indices	 respectively	 had the most accuracy after our equation. We suggest that to get the best equation and cut-off in each region	 one needs to evaluate specific information of each region	 specifically in areas where populations are homogeneous	 to provide a specific formula for differentiating between beta-thal trait and iron deficiency anemia.							
AB Development of sailing tourism is contributes to degradation of the natural environment	 waters of lakes and rivers in particular. Wastewaters produced on sailboats and yachts and deposited in their chemical toilets are usually discharged directly to aquifers	 with a minor part being discharged to collectors for these are located in a few ports only. Thus	 it seems indispensable to develop a complex system of collection and neutralization of such wastewaters. It is	 however	 a difficult process for it requires solving both logistic and technological problems. One of the technological problems may involve adopting an optimum method for neutralization of the wastewaters that usually contain chemical agents for the removal of unpleasant odours	 e.g. Aqua Kem Green type. A solution to this problem may be co-gasification of wastewaters from sailboats with plant biomass in the fermentation process in a biogas works.										
AB This paper explores key factors affecting the operating performance of container terminals	 and compares the performance of various container yard (CY) facilities at the port of Kaohsiung using grey relational analysis (GRA) and the concept of entropy. The paper's findings can be summarised as follows: (1) The most important attributes affecting the operating performance of CY equipment include number of CY facilities	 transport distance of CY tractors	 speed of movement of CY facilities	 handling efficiency of CY facilities	 and number of working tractors. (2) Based on entropy weighting value and GRA	 CY handling facilities can be ranked in terms of operating performance in the order of automatic rail transtainer	 automatic stacking crane	 rail transtainer	 straddle carrier	 and rubber tyred transtainer. (3) From both operating performance and green terminal perspectives	 automatic rail transtainers represent the optimal CY model compared with other container handling facilities.					
AB Closed-loop supply chain management has been identified as an efficient	 effective and economical strategy towards environmental sustainable practices in manufacturing companies. Without a formidable closed-loop supply chain to complement green supply chain management	 most of the goals will not be achieved. A performance evaluation system is crucial for achieving a successful closed-loop supply chain in the automotive industry. Hence	 a suitable expert fuzzy rule-based system for evaluation was developed in this study using Visual Basic.Net. The fuzzy rules and arithmetic used were described. The resulting performance measurement system was evaluated using a case study company from the automotive industry. The study culminated with recommendations and proposal of directions for future studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.													
AB Identifying and analysing key decision variables that an organisation can opt for in order to initiate resource recovery from return activities and improve overall performance is a challenge. Therefore	 to assist organisations which are involved in or about to initiate an effective recovery process	 this paper provides guidelines to establish flexible decision strategies using the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach. This study has identified interrelationships between green variables such as supplier commitment	 cost	 regulations	 etc. and has categorised relevant enablers. Further	 variables such as capacity utilisation	 customer satisfaction	 energy consumption reduction	 etc. are recognised as outcomes or results. After statistically verifying these variables	 it has been inferred that driving enablers aid in promoting performance variables	 while the result variables represent outcomes achieved via the driving variables. Further	 using MICMAC analysis	 a graphical categorisation of the variables is done on the basis of the impact on performance. Later prioritisation of variables having high driving power and low dependence is conducted. Inputs in the proposed model are taken through a case study conducted in the paper industry. The proposed model can be quite helpful and can act as a generic tool to achieve the desired performance improvement of green product recovery systems.			
AB Abstract																
AB Epidemiological studies suggested drinking green tea is inversely associated with esophageal cancer but results remain inconclusive. Moreover	 inconsistent observations found high temperature drinks are associated with esophageal cancer. A population-based case-control study was conducted in a high-risk area (Dafeng) and a low-risk area (Ganyu) of esophageal cancer in Jiangsu province China from 2003 to 2007. It aimed to explore green tea drinking and tea temperature with the risk of esophageal cancer	 and to compare the difference between different risk regions. Using identical protocols	 1	520 cases and 3	879 healthy controls were recruited as study subjects in 2 regions. Detailed information was collected to assess green tea drinking habits. Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain OR and 95% CI. Results showed that ever drinking green tea elevated OR in both counties (Dafeng OR = 1.2	 95% CI = 0.9-1.5; Ganyu: OR = 1.9	 95% CI = 1.42.4). Drinking tea at high temperature was found to increase cancer risk in both areas (Dafeng: OR = 1.9	 95% CI = 1.2-2.9; Ganyu OR = 3.1 95% CI = 2.2-4.3). However	 after further	adjustment for tea temperature	 ever drinking tea was not related to cancer in either county (Dafeng: OR = 1.0	 95% CI = 0.7-1.3; Ganyu: OR = 1.3	 95% CI = 0.9-1.7). For close-response relationships	 we observed positive relationship with monthly consumption of tea (p for trend = 0.067) and tea concentration (p for trend = 0.006) after further adjustment for tea temperature. In conclusion	 green tea drinking was not inversely associated with esophageal cancer in this study. However	 drinking tea at high temperatures significantly increased esophageal cancer risk. There was no obvious difference of green tea drinking between low- and high-risk areas. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss
AB In developing countries	 particularly in Latin America	 the rapid growth of urban areas has led to complex problems	 including the exploitation of natural resources	 environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Massive structures are being built to meet the housing demand. Moreover	 there is excessive use of energy through appliances	 interior lightning and air conditioning which generate GHG. This paper aims to propose green sustainable strategies to reduce GHG emissions associated with energy consumption in a social neighbourhood in Merida	 Mexico. The strategies were eco-technology (efficient equipment) and green spaces (sedum + food production). Once the context is set	 the study collected data about energy habits and consumption. The global warming potential (GWP) was calculated through a life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the level of GHG emissions associated with household energy consumption. The CO(2)eq emissions avoided by the transport of the food (tomatoes) from the production site to the consumer were calculated. Distribution	 packaging and retail were included. All strategies combined can prevent up 1.06 tons CO(2)eq/year; this represents 67% of the emissions originating from a reference household (34% avoided by eco-technology	 24.5% fixed by green spaces and 8.4% avoided by food logistics). At city scale (112	000 houses) this represents 100	352 tons/CO(2)eq/year. This study supports the importance of integrating environmental quantitative tools in planning cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To evaluate the interactive effect of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype and dietary factors on the development of breast cancer	 a hospital based case-control study was conducted in South Korean study population consisting of 189 histologically confirmed incident breast cancer cases and their 189 age-matched controls without present or previous history of cancer. A PCR-RFLP method was used for the genotyping of MTHFR (C677T) and statistical evaluations were performed by unconditional logistic regression analysis. Consumption of some dietary factors	 such as green vegetables (OR = 0.3	 95% CI: 0.2-0.6)	 white vegetables (OR = 0.3	 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) mushrooms (OR = 0.4	 95% CI: 0.3-0.7)	 and meats (OR = 1.7	 95% CI: 1.1-2.8) significantly decreased or increased the risk of breast cancer. Although the breast cancer risk was 1.7-fold (95% CI: 0.8-3.2) increased in women with MTHFR TT genotype	 the association was not statistically significant. Women with MTHFR TT genotype and low green vegetable intake increased 5.6-fold (95% CI: 1.2-26.3) risk of breast cancer compared to high green vegetable intake group containing MTHFR CC/CT genotype. However	 the interaction was not significant (p for interaction = 0.96). Our findings suggest that MTHFR polymorphism did not influence individual susceptibility to breast cancer. However MTHFR (C667T) genotype and green vegetable intakes appeared to have the interactive effect in breast cancer development.						
AB Background: The anti-influenza virus activity of green tea catechins has been demonstrated in experimental studies	 but clinical evidence has been inconclusive. School-aged children play an important role in the infection and spread of influenza in the form of school-based outbreaks. Preventing influenza infection among students is essential for reducing the frequency of epidemics and pandemics. As a non-pharmaceutical intervention against infection	 gargling is also commonly performed in Asian countries but has not yet been extensively studied.														
AB Background: The present study investigates how often a simultaneous fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography had therapeutic consequences and if it is useful as a clinical routine diagnostic tool. Patients and methods: 502 consecutive simultaneous angiographies in eyes with exudative macular degeneration were retrospectively studied. Results: A classic extra- or juxtafoveolar choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) was found in 3.5% of the eyes. A subfoveal predominantly classic CNV was present in 19% of the angiographies. ICG angiography showed a vascular network in 3% of the eyes with occult CNV in fluorescein angiography. A neovascularisation supplied by retinal vessels (retinal angiomatous proliferation) was found in 9% and a polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in 6%. Other plaques or hot spots were visible in 4%. In 11 eyes with progressive exudation from PCV and threatening of the fovea	 laser treatment was successfully performed. Conclusions: Combined angiography identifies treatable PCV. Advantages of a combined procedure (easier logistics	 no missing of treatable cases) and arguments for a two step procedure with ICG angiography only in selected cases (lower costs	 lower rate of adverse reactions) must be weighed against each other.													
AB Potential consequences of disasters involve overwhelming economic losses	 large affected populations and serious environmental damages. Given these devastating effects	 there is an increasing interest in developing measures in order to diminish the possible impact of disasters	 which gave rise to the field of disaster operations management (DOM). In this paper we review recent OR/MS research in DOM. Our work is a continuation of a previous review from Altay and Green (2006). Our purpose is to evaluate how OR/MS research in DOM has evolved in the last years and to what extent the gaps identified by Altay and Green (2006) have been covered. Our findings show no drastic changes or developments in the field of OR/MS in DOM since the publication of Altay and Green (2006). Additionally to our comparative analysis	 we present an original evaluation about the most common assumptions in recent OR/MS literature in DOM. Based on our findings we provide future research directions in order to make improvements in the areas where lack of research is detected. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.												
AB Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between green tea consumption and gastric cancer development. Methods: A population-based case-control study including 200 cases and 200 controls was conducted in the southwest area of China from May 2010 to February 2011. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect data on factors influencing gastric cancer development	 including tea drinking	 conditional logistic regression being used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Cases with higher economic status had a reduced risk of gastric cancer	 while those with cancer family history	 drinking and smoking showed increased risk. Hot and very hot tea temperature was significantly related to high risk of gastric cancer with ORs (95% Cl) of 1.82 (1.03-3.52) and 3.07 (1.78-7.36)	 respectively. Further analysis indicated elevated risk of gastric cancer in former drinkers	 former smokers and current drinkers when the measured tea temperature was hot. Conclusion: Drinking tea at high temperature increases the gastric cancer risk	 especially in drinkers and smokers.									
AB As the green movement spreads across the globe	 organizations are under pressure to reduce the emissions across their supply chain. On the other hand	 they need to cut supply costs to gain a competitive edge. This paper proposes Green DEA (GDEA)	 a comprehensive approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with carbon footprint monitoring. GDEA builds on an existing DEA model with weight restrictions and dual role factors	 and introduces carbon footprints as necessary dual role factors with weight restrictions. Unlike other researches	 GDEA incorporates heterogeneous suppliers and also takes into account regional emission compliance standards and laws. GDEA encourages suppliers to go green and cut down their carbon footprints and comply with emission norms along with reducing costs in order to survive competition. Results from model validation in a well-known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India are presented to verify the GDEA approach. Overall	 GDEA cuts across a huge and varied supplier base	 caters to almost all businesses	 is environment-friendly and robust. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.								
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate why companies reduce transportation emissions by examining the relative importance of external drivers vs internal motives for companies in considering CO2 emissions in freight transportation.																
AB Reverse logistics (RL) practices represent an important and emerging trend in China's manufacturing practices. An increasing number of Chinese manufacturers have integrated RL practices in their operations to develop sustainable competitive advantage. There are six broad aspects of practicing RL which include waste management	 recycling	 reuse	 reprocessing	 materials recovery	 and design for RL. The literature remains unclear	 in particular Chinese manufacturing context	 as to how these Rh practices are related to organizational bottom line with respect to operational	 financial	 and social performance outcomes. Using survey data collected from Chinese export-oriented manufacturers	 we applied seemingly unrelated regressions to determine if these six RL practices contribute to these three performance parameters simultaneously. The theory of production frontier is used to characterize the RL practices adoption and the performance implications. Our results indicate that the adoption of RL practices by Chinese manufacturers generates substantial environmental and financial gains	 but not social benefits. This study extends the frontier of managerial knowledge for Chinese manufacturers by highlighting the emerging trends in RL practices and providing evidence on the business value of adopting RL practices.

AB This study aimed at understanding the contribution of the fruit physicochemical parameters to Musa sp. diversity and plantain ripening stages. A discriminant analysis was first performed on a collection of 35 Musa sp. cultivars	 organized in six groups based on the consumption mode (dessert or cooking banana) and the genomic constitution. A principal component analysis reinforced by a logistic regression on plantain cultivars was proposed as an analytical approach to describe the plantain ripening stages. The results of the discriminant analysis showed that edible fraction	 peel pH	 pulp water content	 and pulp total phenolics were among the most contributing attributes for the discrimination of the cultivar groups. With mean values ranging from 65.4 to 247.3 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight	 the pulp total phenolics strongly differed between interspecific and monospecific cultivars within dessert and nonplantain cooking bananas. The results of the logistic regression revealed that the best models according to fitting parameters involved more than one physicochemical attribute. Interestingly	 pulp and peel total phenolic contents contributed in the building up of these models.										
AB Rework is described as the transformation of production rejects into re-usable products of the same or lower quality. Rework can be very profitable	 especially if disposal costs are high and if materials are expensive and limited in availability. Furthermore	 rework can contribute to a 'green image'.														
AB The growth profile of five strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287	 L plantarum ACA-DC 146	 Lactobacillus paracasei ACA-DC 4037	 Lactobacillus sakei LQC 1378	 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides LQC 1398) was investigated in controlled fermentation of cv. Conservolea green olives with a multilayer perceptron network	 a combined logistic-Fermi function	 and a two-term Gompertz function. Neural network training was based on the steepest-descent gradient learning algorithm. Model performance was compared with the experimental data with five statistical indices	 namely coefficient of determination (R-2)	 root mean square error (RMSE)	 mean relative percentage error (MRPE)	 mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)	 and standard error of prediction (SEP). The experimental data set consisted of 125 counts (CFU per milliliter) of lactic acid bacteria during the green olive fermentation process for up to 38 days (5 strains X 25 sampling days). For model development	 a standard methodology was followed	 dividing the data set into training (120 data) and validation (25 data) subsets. Our results demonstrated that the developed network was able to model the growth and survival profile of all the strains of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation equally well with the statistical models. The performance indices for the training subset of the multilayer perception network were R-2 = 0.987	 RMSE = 0.097	 MRPE = 0.069	 MAPE = 0.933
AB Fresh vegetables are increasingly recognized as a source of foodborne outbreaks in many parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment for Escherichia coli O157:H7	 Salmonella	 and and Listeria monocytogenes infection from consumption of leafy green vegetables in salad bars in The Netherlands. Pathogen growth was modeled in Aladin (Agro Logistics Analysis and Design Instrument) using time-temperature profiles in the chilled supply chain and one particular restaurant with a salad bar. A second-order Monte Carlo risk assessment model was constructed (using @Risk) to estimate the public health effects. The temperature in the studied cold chain as well controlled below 5 degrees C. Growth of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella was minimal (17 and 15%	 respectively). Growth of L. monocytogenes was considerably greater (194%). Based on first-order Monte Carlo simulations	 the average number of cases per year in The Netherlands associated the consumption leafy greens in salads from salad bars was 166	 187. and 0.3 for E. coli 01 57:H7	 Salmonella. and L. monocytogenes	 respectively. The ranges of the average number of annual cases as estimated by second-order Monte Carlo simulation (with prevalence and number of visitors as uncertain variables) were 42 to 551 for E. coli O157:H7	 81 to 281 for Salmonella	 and 0.1 to 0.9 for L. monocytogenes. This study included an integration of modeling pathogen growth in the supply chain of fresh leafy vegetables destined for restaurant salad bars using software designed to model and design logistics and modeling file Public health effects using probabilistic risk assessment software.							
AB Earth observation data	 owing to their synoptic	 timely and repetitive coverage	 have been recognized as a valuable tool for crop monitoring at different levels. At the field level	 the close correlation between green leaf area (GLA) during maturation and grain yield in wheat revealed that the onset and rate of senescence appeared to be important factors for determining wheat grain yield. Our study sought to explore a simple approach for wheat yield forecasting at the regional level	 based on metrics derived from the senescence phase of the green area index (GAI) retrieved from remote sensing data. This study took advantage of recent methodological improvements in which imagery with high revisit frequency but coarse spatial resolution can be exploited to derive crop-specific GAI time series by selecting pixels whose ground-projected instantaneous field of view is dominated by the target crop: winter wheat. A logistic function was used to characterize the GAI senescence phase and derive the metrics of this phase. Four regression-based models involving these metrics (i.e.	 the maximum GAI value	 the senescence rate and the thermal time taken to reach 50% of the green surface in the senescent phase) were related to official wheat yield data. The performances of such models at this regional scale showed that final yield could be estimated with an RMSE of 0.57 ton ha(-1)	 representing about 7% as relative RMSE. Such an approach may be considered as a first yield estimate that could be performed in order to provide better integrated yield assessments in operational systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in developed countries and is increasing in the developing world. Its long latency and geographical variation suggest the possibility of prevention or postponement of onset by dietary modification. To investigate the possible joint effect of lycopene and green tea on prostate cancer risk	 a case-control study was conducted in Hangzhou	 China	 with 130 prostate cancer patients and 274 hospital controls. Information on tea and dietary intakes	 and possible confounders was collected using a structured questionnaire. The risk of prostate cancer for the intake of tea and lycopene and their joint effect were assessed using multivariate logistic regression models. Prostate cancer risk was reduced with increased consumption of green tea. The protective effect of green tea was significant (odds ratio 0.14	 95% Cl: 0.06-0.35) for the highest quartile relative to the lowest after adjusting for total vegetables and fruits intakes and other potential confounding factors. Intakes of vegetables and fruits rich in lycopene were also inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio 0.18	 95% Cl 0.08-0.39). Interaction analysis showed that the protective effect from tea and lycopene consumption was synergistic (p < 0.01). This study suggests that habitual drinking tea and intakes of vegetables and fruits rich in lycopene could lead to a reduced risk of prostate cancer in Chinese men. Together they have a stronger preventive effect than either component taken separately. This is the first epidemiological study to investigate the joint effect between tea drinking and lycopene intake.										
AB A multicenter hospital-based case-control study comprising 670 incident cases of esophageal cancer (EC) and 1188 controls	 frequency-matched for age and sex	 was conducted to evaluate the role of diet on EC development in the Eastern Cape Province	 South Africa. A locally relevant lifestyle and dietary questionnaire was used. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using unconditional multivariable logistic regression. Individually	 maize or sorghum consumption vs. never or rare consumption were not associated with EC (P > 0.1). Males and females consuming green leafy vegetables 5-7 days/wk had 38% (P = 0.04) and 50% (P = 0.007) reduced odds of developing EC	 respectively	 compared with consumption <= 1 day/wk. A similar reduction in odds was observed with fruit consumption. Principal component factor analysis revealed 3 distinct dietary patterns. In females	 high vs. low consumption of Pattern 1 (sorghum	 green leafy vegetables	 green legumes	 fruits	 meat) was inversely associated with EC development (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34-0.89)	 whereas for Pattern 2 (maize	 wild greens-imifino	 dry beans) the odds were elevated (OR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.04-2.67). Compared with low adherence	 high adherence to Pattern 3 (wheat-based products) reduced the odds by 35% for both sexes. This study provides further evidence on the role of diet in minimizing EC risk in this population.	
AB During vacuum-packaged frozen storage of fatty goose liver (foie gras)	 a yet unknown	 but fully reversible (package opening and thawing)	 greening was found at a Hungarian processing plant. Laboratory analysis revealed hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and remnant blood in 35 livers. Microbial spoilage was under the limit of detection for H2S-producing strains. In liver homogenates and in thawing exudates	 sulfhemoglobin was found and confirmed (acid-alkali reactions)	 with spectrophotometric analysis. Slaughtered geese are chilled to 2C (24h) in a non-eviscerated condition to maintain liver shape. With logistic regression	 the H2S (most probably from the intestinal tract) was of primary importance in the green color development. In an experimental group (n=10) dissected after 2h of body chilling	 H2S was absent in the liver. Results indicate that intestinal tract-originated H2S is diffusing the fattened goose liver	 leading to a color defect of a delicatesse	 without consumer health risks. Practical Applications Hungary leads the world's foie gras production	 and a rarely occurring production-technology-associated green color defect negatively affects product perception. Fattened	 slaughtered geese are chilled to 2C for 24h in a non-eviscerated form to keep liver intact during dissection. Based on the industrial observations and analytical results	 foie gras contains sulfhemoglobin	 a non-toxic	 green pigment	 which is sensitive towards oxidative stimuli. The color defect occurs only in frozen-stored and vacuum-packaged livers. After excluding microbiological spoilage and proving the presence of sulfhemoglobin	 we suggest the application of an oxidative packaging technology
AB An organization's environmental performance is affected by its suppliers' environmental performance	 and selecting green suppliers is a strategic decision in order to be more competitive in today's global market. The supplier selection problem involves several quantitative and qualitative criteria. In the supplier selection process	 if suppliers have limited capacity or other constraints	 it is necessary to determine the best supplier and order quantity of each supplier. In this paper	 we present an integrated approach	 of fuzzy multi attribute utility theory and multi-objective programming	 for rating and selecting the best green suppliers according to economic and environmental criteria and then allocating the optimum order quantities among them. At first	 the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is applied in order to analyze the importance of multiple criteria by incorporating experts' opinion and to determine the best green suppliers. Next	 multi-objective linear programming is used to consider and to formulate various constraints such as quality control	 capacity	 and other objectives. The objective of the mathematical model is simultaneously to maximize the total value of purchasing and to minimize the total cost of purchasing. To handle the subjectivity of decision makers' preferences	 fuzzy logic has been applied. The efficiency and application of the proposed approach has been illustrated with a case study in an automobile manufacturing company. The obtained results help firms establish a systematic approach for tackling green supplier selection and order allocation problems in a realistic situation. Finally managerial implications	 conclusions	 and directions for additional research are introduced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.			
AB To investigate whether green tea consumption has an etiological association with prostate cancer	 a case-control study was conducted in Hangzhou	 southeast China during 2001-2002. The cases were 130 incident patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The controls were 274 hospital inpatients without prostate cancer or any other malignant diseases	 and matched to the age of cases. Information on duration	 quantity and frequency of usual tea consumption	 as well as the number of new batches brewed per day	 were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. The risk of prostate cancer for tea consumption was assessed using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age	 locality	 education	 income	 body mass index	 physical activity	 alcohol consumption	 tobacco smoking	 total fat intake	 marital status	 age at marriage
AB Estimating winter wheat yield through the decreasing phase of its green area. A large number of agrometeorological models for crop yield assessment are available with various levels of complexity and empiricism. However	 the current development of models for wheat yield forecasting does not always reflect the inclusion of the loss of valuable green area and its relation to biotic and abiotic processes in production situation. In this study the senescence phase of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is monitored through the GAI (Green Area Index)	 calculated from digital hemispherical photographies taken over plots in Belgium	 Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and France. Two curve-fitting functions (modified Gompertz and modified logistic) are used to describe the senescence phase. Metrics derived from these functions and characterizing this phase (i.e. the maximum value of GAI	 the senescence rate and the time taken to reach either 37% or 50% of the green surface in the senescent phase) are related to final grain yields. The regression-based models calculated with these metrics showed that final yield could be estimated with a coefficient of determination of 0.83 and a RMSE of 0.48 t.ha(-1). Such simple models may be considered as a first yield estimates that may be performed in order to provide a better integrated yield assessment in operational systems. Indeed	 estimation of cereal-crop production	 particularly wheat	 is considered as a priority in most crop research programs due to the relevance of food grain to world agricultural production.									
AB Purpose - Managing the green (environmentally sustainable) supply chain is an important issue for industry. This paper aims to provide a framework to understand and appreciate the relationships of various research streams and topics in this field. Utilizing this framework	 emergent research directions to advance the field are also presented.															
AB To investigate effects of dietary mushrooms and joint effects of mushrooms and green tea on breast cancer	 a case-control study was conducted in southeast China in 2004-2005. The incident cases were 1	009 female patients aged 20-87 years with histologically confirmed breast cancer. The 1	009 age-matched controls were healthy women randomly recruited from outpatient breast clinics. Information on frequency and quantity of dietary intake of mushrooms and tea consumption	 usual diet	 and lifestyle were collected by face-to-face interview using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Compared with nonconsumers	 the Odds ratios (Ors) were 0.36 (95% Cl = 0.25-0.51) and 0.53 (0.38-0.73) for daily intake of >= 10 g fresh mushrooms and >= 4 g dried mushrooms	 based on multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for established and potential confounders. There were dose-response relationships with significant tests for trend (p < 0.001). The inverse association was found in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Compared with those who consumed neither mushrooms nor green tea	 the ORs were 0.11 (0.06-0.20) and 0.18 (0.11-0.29) for daily high intake of fresh and dried mushrooms combined with consuming beverages made from >= 1.05 g dried green tea leaves per day. The corresponding linear trends were statistically significant for joint effect (p < 0.001). We conclude that higher dietary intake of mushrooms decreased breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal Chinese women and an additional decreased risk of breast cancer from joint effect of mushrooms and green tea was observed. More research is warranted to examine the effects of dietary mushrooms and mechanism of joint effects of phytochemicals on breast cancer. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss	 Inc.							
AB Background: It is unclear whether consumption of coffee and green tea is associated with metabolic syndrome.																
AB The purpose of our study was to examine the roles of green tea drinking	 other risk and protective factors	 and polymorphism of susceptibility genes such as GSTM1	 GSTT1	 GSTP1	 and p53 codon 72 and their possible joint effects on the risk of stomach cancer. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Taixing	 China	 including 206 newly diagnosed cases with stomach cancer and 415 healthy control subjects. Epidemiological data were collected by in-person interviews using a standard questionnaire. Polymorphisms of susceptibility genes were assayed by PCR-RFLP techniques. A multigenetic index was created by summing up the number of risk genotypes. The data were analyzed using the logistic regression model. A reverse association between green tea drinking and risk of stomach cancer was observed with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.34-1.01). Dose-response relationship was shown (p-trend <0.05). A higher score on the multigenetic index was associated with increased risk of stomach cancer with an adjusted OR of 2.21 (95% CI=1.02-4.79) for those with at least 3 risk genotypes compared to those with <2 risk genotypes. Green tea drinking was suggested to have more than multiplicative interactions with alcohol consumption with an adjusted OR for interaction of 4.57 (95% CI=1.62-12.89)	 and with higher multigenetic index with adjusted OR for interaction of 2.31 (95% CI=0.88-6.03). The protective effect of green tea drinking was observed on the risk of stomach cancer and the possible effect modification by susceptibility genes was suggested. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss	 Inc.							
AB In Central Europe and North America	 bark beetle infestations cause considerable economic losses. If infested trees are not rapidly removed	" large areas can be damaged. Removal of infested trees has to be done during the so-called ""green-attack"" stage"	" which is before the bark beetles move to other trees. Field surveys even if they are feasible are cost intensive and impractical if large areas have to be monitored. The aim of the study was to analyse the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite imagery for detecting bark beetle infestations of two intensity stages (e.g. ""dead"" and ""green-attack"") against ""healthy"" (non-attacked) trees. For classifying individual trees two classifiers"	 random forest and logistic regression	 were evaluated. Despite the relative large class overlap in the spectral signatures	" the sample trees (n = 600) could be assigned to the classes ""dead"""	" ""green-attack"""	" and ""healthy"" with an overall accuracy of about 75%. Producer's and user's accuracies of all classes were around 70%. The best result was obtained with random forests using the eight spectral bands of a WorldView-2 image acquired in July. With this dataset"	" an overall accuracy of 76% and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 were achieved. For the separation of the classes ""healthy"" and ""green-attack"""	 vegetation indices based on 2-band normalized differences as well as ratios yielded nearly as good results as the classification with all eight spectral bands. The best results were obtained by combining either the Green or Yellow band with the Near Infrared 1. With regard to individual bands	 the Yellow and the Red band are defined as most important ones. We can conclude that 8-band WorldView-2 imagery has the potential for creating hotspot maps of infested trees or of trees with an increased risk of infestation. This could have positive implications for the forest practice.					
AB Trustworthy eco-labels provide consumers with valuable information on environmentally friendly products and thus promote green consumerism. But what makes an eco-label trustworthy and what can government do to increase consumer confidence? The scant existing literature indicates that low governmental involvement increases confidence. This suggests that government should just provide the basic legal framework for eco-labeling and leave the rest to non-governmental organizations. However	 the empirical underpinning of this conclusion is insufficient. This paper analyses consumer confidence in different organic food labeling regimes with varying degrees of governmental involvement. Using unique and detailed survey data from the US	 United Kingdom	 Denmark	 and Sweden	 the analysis shows that confidence is highest in countries with substantial state involvement. This suggests that governments can increase green consumerism through active and substantial involvement in eco-labeling.											
AB Researchers in several business disciplines have convincingly argued that environmentally responsible strategies can contribute to competitive advantage and superior financial performance. While debates on ecological conservation and environmental practices within marketing have raged for over three decades	 much of the focus has been on identifying and targeting the environmentally-conscious consumer. Less attention has been given to marketing's role in a green supply chain and its interface with environmentally-friendly manufacturing and operations. We integrate disparate streams of research and develop a broader framework to understand the appropriate role and focus of business-to-business marketing in the supply chain for achieving environmental sustainability objectives. We identify three major strategies - the reduction of surplus supply of products	 reduction of reverse supply	 and internal marketing - where marketing's role in environmental sustainability is crucial for achieving superior competitive advantage and financial performance.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of eco-oriented culture (EOC) in the relationship between stakeholder pressure (SP) and the adoption of environmental logistics practices (ELPs). It is proposed that the adoption of ELPs is influenced by SP perceived by a firm	 and in turn this relationship is mediated by EOC.															
AB The development period of immature stages of the green apple aphid	 Aphis pomi (DeGeer) (Homoptera: Aphididae)	 at six constant temperature regimens (20	 24	 28	 30	 32	 and 34 degrees C) was modeled to determine mathematical functions for simulating aphid development. Ten models (one linear and nine nonlinear) were used to describe the relationships between temperature and development rate of the different instars and stages of A. pomi (DeGeer) at constant temperatures. All models (except logistic and linear) provided accurate values for the optimum temperature for the first-	 second-	 third-	 and fourth-instar larvae and for total development. The results suggest that	 among four models (Hilbert and Logan	 Lactin	 Briere	 and Analytis) that estimate all three parameters (t(min)	 t(opt)	 t(max))
AB Increased awareness of the environmental and social impacts caused by logistics and distribution has resulted in a sharper focus on this theme both in the literature and from industry. Research in this field has developed in order to take so-called 'green effects' into consideration when investigating distribution networks. However	 few papers actually provide quantitative models to estimate external transport costs. Most of the contributions relate to qualitative and multi-objective research	 trying to define and estimate external impacts	 without providing any actual cost values. The present paper analyses a range of international researches and sets out an innovative quantitative model based on findings from the relevant literature. This model has been applied to a real industrial case in order to demonstrate the importance of considering the environmental impacts when designing a distribution network. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to show how external cost variations impact on distribution network design.													
AB We consider a supply chain network design problem that takes CO2 emissions into account. Emission costs are considered alongside fixed and variable location and production costs. The relationship between CO2 emissions and vehicle weight is modeled using a concave function leading to a concave minimization problem. As the direct solution of the resulting model is not possible	 Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose the problem into a capacitated facility location problem with single sourcing and a concave knapsack problem that can be solved easily. A Lagrangian heuristic based on the solution of the subproblem is proposed. When evaluated on a number of problems with varying capacity and cost characteristics	 the proposed algorithm achieves solutions within 1% of the optimal. The test results indicate that considering emission costs can change the optimal configuration of the supply chain	 confirming that emission costs should be considered when designing supply chains in jurisdictions with carbon costs.

AB Distribution of goods involves massive deployment of vehicles whose emissions are a major concern for environmentalists. Factors such as speed	 nature of the road	 load carried and other vehicle parameters apart from the distance are known to affect the emissions as well as the consumption of fuel. Between the same pair of nodes	 taking an alternative route with different lengths and velocities can result in reduced fuel consumption. Literature suggests that minimising the consumption of fuel results in reducing the emission of harmful gases and of particulate matter. We formulate a multiple-route-vehicle-routing problem to evaluate alternative routes between nodes and solve for minimising the fuel consumption. The results from trial data-sets provide insights into the impact of the solutions on the number of vehicles used	 fuel consumed	 distance travelled	 travel time and cost. This paper provides a means of routing distribution vehicles so as to reduce their impact on the environment.										
AB The safety level of signalized intersection depends greatly on drivers' decision-making behaviors	 which are significantly influenced by the time-reminder strategy before amber of the signal device. However	 previous related studies are mainly based on the statistical results from the field data rather than explore the influence mechanism of the signal device on the signalized intersection's safety level. Therefore	 this study aims to find out how these three typical signal devices with various time-reminder strategies	 i.e.	 common signal device (CSD)	 green signal flashing device (GSFD)	 and green signal countdown device (GSCD)	 affect drivers' decision-making processes during the period from the end of the green phase to the onset of the red phase (i.e.	 G2R) and then evaluate their safety performance from the aspect of RLR violations. Firstly	 an overall decision-making framework during G2R is presented to describe the driver-signal interaction and encloses four decision-making processes	 which can be analyzed and modeled based on the field data collected from six signalized intersections in Changsha	 China. Empirical analyses show that the time point of decision-making before amber under GSCD is the earliest and that under CSD is the latest	 which can also be modeled and reproduced by back propagation neural network (BPNN). After that	 five binary logistic regression models are developed to determine the safety effect during other various processes and results show that red-light-running (RLR) violations are not only dependent on the range of dilemma zones (DZ) but also substantially on stop and go decisions of those vehicles in DZ	 both of which are the potential cause and direct factors to RLR violations and found to be significantly affected by the time-reminder strategy of the green signal device. Finally	 although GSCD stimulates the drivers in DZ to choose to cross the intersection during amber
AB Quality problems occurring during or after sea transportation of bananas in refrigerated containers are mainly caused by insufficient cooling and non-optimal atmospheric conditions	 but also by the heat generated by respiration activity. Tools to measure and evaluate these effects can largely help to reduce losses along the banana supply chain. The presented green life model provides a tool to predict the effect of deviating temperature	 relative humidity	 and CO2 and O-2 gas concentrations on the storage stability of bananas. A second thermal model allows evaluation of the cooling efficiency	 the effect of changes in packaging and stowage and the amount of respiration heat from the measured temperature curves. Spontaneous ripening causes higher respiration heat and CO2 production rate. The resulting risk for creation of hot spots increases in positions in which the respiration heat exceeds the available cooling capacity. In case studies on the transport of bananas from Costa Rica to Europe	 we validated the models and showed how they can be applied to generate automated warning messages for containers with reduced banana green life or with temperature problems and also for remote monitoring of the ripening process inside the container.											
AB The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze the published definitions of green supply chain management (GSCM) and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). A total of 22 definitions for GSCM and 12 definitions for SSCM were identified. In order to analyze the identified definitions	 two different sets of key characteristics for business sustainability (i.e.	 economic	 environmental	 social	 stakeholder	 volunteer	 resilience	 and long-term focuses) and SCM (i.e.	 flow	 coordination	 stakeholder	 relationship	 value	 efficiency	 and performance focuses) were proposed. The identified definitions were analyzed against each other and the two sets of proposed key characteristics. The analysis shows that definitions for GSCM were generally more narrowly focused than those for SSCM and had an emphasis on the characteristics of environmental	 flow
AB The functional response of the indigenous green lacewing Chrysoperla nipponensis (Okamoto) and the imported green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) feeding on seven different densities of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Homoptera: Aphididae) was studied under laboratory conditions at 20 C. C. nipponensis and C. carnea have shown a Type II functional response based on logistic regression analysis. The maximum number of prey eaten by C. cornea was higher than C. nipponensis. Handling time decreased at 24 h for both species	 but was higher for C. nipponensis at 12 and 24 h than for C. carnea. The attack coefficient of C. nipponensis was slightly higher than C. carnea in second and third instars. These results indicate that C. carnea may eat more aphids at high prey densities; however	 C. nipponensis could be considered a prospective candidate for use as a commercial biological control agent for aphids in Japan. C. nipponensis will become more important than C. carnea from the viewpoint of environmental safety because it is a native species adapted to the Japanese environment	 and nontarget effects can be avoided.													
AB This paper examines the willingness of hoteliers	 in Corfu Island of Greece	 to invest in proactive energy management practices and environmental management systems to address energy problems. Three binary logistic regression models were estimated to identify those variables that affect hoteliers' willingness to install solar water heaters	 air condition inverter and to adopt EMS. It is reported that in the hotel sector there is place for energy and management improvements. This can be achieved if specific information and fiscal incentives are applied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The transport sector is the second-largest carbon emissions contributor in Europe	 and its emissions continue to increase. Many producers are committing themselves to reducing transport emissions voluntarily	 possibly in anticipation of increasing transport prices. In this paper we study a producer that has outsourced transport and has decided to cap its carbon emissions from outbound logistics for a group of customers. Setting an emission constraint for a group of customers allows for taking advantage of the portfolio effect. We focus on reducing emissions by switching transport modes within an existing network	 because this has a large impact on emissions. In addition	 the company sets the sales prices	 which influence demand. The problem is solved by decomposing the multiproduct problem into several single-product problems	 which we then analyze separately. Using the single-product solutions	 we create an efficient frontier that reflects the trade-off between total carbon emissions and the total profit. It is observed that a diminishing rate of return applies in reducing emissions by switching transport modes. In a case study	 we apply our method to a producer of bulk liquids and find that emissions can be reduced by 10% at only a 0.7% increase in total logistics cost.								
AB Purpose - Suppliers	 manufacturers	 wholesalers	" and retailers alike are still considering reverse logistics (RL) to be the ""necessary evil"" in their day-to-day operations rather than an opportunity for future performance. At the same time"	 a well-structured RL program can create a substantial value-added and positively affect the bottom-line. Based on in-depth investigation of best-in-class RL programs implemented in practice	 the purpose of this paper is to offer a grounded flow charting approach for assessing the state of program development and	 potentially	 identifying areas for improvement across different companies in various industries.									
AB Flooding can have catastrophic effects on human lives and livelihoods and thus comprehensive flood management is needed. Such management requires information on the hydrologic	 geotechnical	 environmental	 social	 and economic aspects of flooding. The number of flood events that took place in Busan	 South Korea	 in 2009 exceeded the normal situation for that city. Mapping the susceptible areas helps us to understand flood trends and can aid in appropriate planning and flood prevention. In this study	 a combination of bivariate probability analysis and multivariate logistic regression was used to produce flood susceptibility maps of Busan City. The main aim of this research was to overcome the weakness of logistic regression regarding bivariate probability capabilities. Aflood inventory map with a total of 160 flood locations was extracted from various sources. Then	 the flood inventory was randomly split into a testing dataset 70 % for training the models and the remaining 30 %	 which was used for validation. Independent variables datasets included the rainfall	 digital elevation model	 slope	 curvature	 geology	 green farmland	 rivers	 slope
AB In this paper we develop a stochastic programming approach to solve a multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning problem in a green supply chain for a medium-term planning horizon under the assumption of demand uncertainty. The proposed model has the following features: (i) the majority of supply chain cost parameters are considered; (ii) quantity discounts to encourage the producer to order more from the suppliers in one period	 instead of splitting the order into periodical small quantities	 are considered; (iii) the interrelationship between lead time and transportation cost is considered	 as well as that between lead time and greenhouse gas emission level; (iv) demand uncertainty is assumed to follow a pre-specified distribution function; (v) shortages are penalized by a general multiple breakpoint function	 to persuade producers to reduce backorders as much as possible; (vi) some indicators of a green supply chain	 such as greenhouse gas emissions and waste management are also incorporated into the model. The proposed model is first a nonlinear mixed integer programming which is converted into a linear one by applying some theoretical and numerical techniques. Due to the convexity of the model	 the local solution obtained from linear programming solvers is also the global solution. Finally	 a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									
AB In most Chinese cities	 electric bicycles and electrically assisted bicycles (e-bikes) have drastically increased in recent years and currently constitute the largest proportion of the nonmotorized traffic at signalized intersections. Proper treatment of e-bikes has become a vitally important issue in improving the operational efficiency and safety performance of signalized intersections. However	 fundamental knowledge of the unique operating characteristics and behavior of riders of e-bikes under various conditions is insufficient. This study statistically analyzed critical behavioral parameters of e-bike riders and empirically modeled their start-up behavior at the green onset following a 3-s red-and-yellow signal and their stop-pass decision behavior at the yellow onset following a 3-s flashing green. Distribution types and parameters of desired speed	 start-up time	 acceleration rate	 perception-reaction time	 and deceleration rate were investigated with the use of highly accurate trajectory data. A temporal-spatial model was developed to interpret the start-up curve	 and three binary logistic regression models were built to predict the stop-pass decisions for different rider groups. It was found that the start-up curve of e-bikes could be well described by a quadratic function and that the red-and-yellow signal significantly induced a hurried start. The potential time to the stop line at the decision point was found to be the dominant independent factor explaining the stop-pass decision of e-bike riders; the flashing green signal seemed to enlarge the option zone	 bring the indecision zone earlier	 and result in more aggressive passing behavior.							
AB Knowledge of residue cover is crucial for targeting conservation efforts to reduce soil erosion	 runoff	 and associated environmental impacts; however	 a rapid	 accurate	 inexpensive methodology is not currently available. Previous studies have shown mixed results detecting crop residue using Landsat residue indices	 but conditions generally included poor soil color contrast	 emergent vegetation	 or categorized residue cover. Our objectives were to evaluate a new normalized difference residue index (NDRI)	 along with other indices	 over multiple image dates in 2005 and 2006 on dark soils in north-central Iowa. An automated method for field boundary delineation was used. The NDRI	 using Landsat Bands 3 and 7	 performed best overall	 explaining 81% of the residue cover differences overall	 78% before emergence	 and 9% after emergence. The normalized difference tillage index (NDTI)	 using Landsat Bands 5 and 7
AB The consideration of environmental issues has emerged as a topic of critical importance for today's globalized supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategic-tactical decision support model to assist managers in evaluating the impact of environmental issues	 related to transportation emissions	 on the transport geography of a region. Specifically we provide a model that addresses: (i) supply chain network design	 including port of entry and transportation mode	 and (ii) decisions on using dedicated versus shared warehouses and transportation. The applicability of the proposed methodology is examined through the development of a sustainable supply chain network in the South-Eastern Europe region. The results indicate that in most cases using shared warehouses from Third Party Logistics operators improves both the cost and the environmental performance of a company. In all cases shared use of transportation operations minimizes the amount of CO2 and PM emissions generated	 while dedicated use minimizes costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to improve the worsening air pollution problem in Chinese cities	" Chinese government has been vigorously developing the building of urban forest under the policy of ""government leading"	" market driving and residents participating"". However"	 residents are still unwilling to join in city greening. Therefore	 it is very necessary to find out some effective methods to encourage residents to participate in urban forest ecological service. The paper firstly presents 7 Logistic regression models for residents' supplying forest ecological service	 and then the probabilities of the residents' willingness and unwillingness to supply urban forest ecological service are calculated using the proposed models. The probability analysis reveals that the invested amounts of residents with different income are with great difference	 and residents unwilling to pay are mainly those who are over 60 years old or who have monthly income of less than RMB 600. Finally	 the paper proposes some valuable suggestions to encourage residents to supply urban forest ecological service. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.									
AB This study assessed underlying natural and cultural determinants of tree health and ways to improve urban forest performance in compact Nanjing city. Two groups of factors were investigated: (1) habitat conditions	 including planting site	 ground-cover	 land cover	 and district; and (2) tree traits	 including species provenance and seasonality	 and tree dimensions. A stratified sampling strategy selected 6351 trees for detailed assessment. The data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regressions. Institutional	 park-garden and industrial trees with more open-space sites with vegetated ground-cover performed better than roadside and residential ones. Poor trees in confined residential sites deviated from those in other cities. Park-garden sites did not always nurture meritorious	 large and diversified trees. District differentiation in tree performance was related to land cover. Exotic and evergreen species grew better than indigenous and deciduous	 offering hints on species-habitat matching. Detailed field and statistical analyses could yield tree-environment information to enhance urban forestry research and management.							
AB Background/Aim: Hepatectomy without recurrence for more than five years may be considered as being a sufficient resection of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the predictive factors for sufficient resection for HCC patients. Patients and Methods: In our Department	 77 patients with HCC survived without recurrence for more than five years following hepatectomy (curative group) and 187 patients underwent hepatectomy but developed recurrence within five years (recurrence group). We compared the clinicopathology between these two groups and evaluated the favorable factors for HCC without recurrence using logistic regression analysis. Results: The curative group was associated with three independent factors by multivariate logistic regression analyses: tumor size	 serum indocyanine green retention rate (ICG15) and anatomic wide hepatectomy (all p<0.05). Conclusion: Sufficient resection is closely related to patient	 tumor	 and treatment factors. Anatomic wide hepatectomy for small (<29 mm) HCC in patients with sufficient liver function (ICG15 <16.5%) can achieve sufficient resection.												
AB Purpose - The aim of this study is to understand the effect of a firm's position in a supply chain in its industry on the attitude of the firm toward green strategies through empirical data analysis. This study aims to answer the following research questions: Do the environmental uncertainties a firm faces differ with the firm's position in the supply chain when going green?	 Would the motivation of a firm for going green vary with uncertainties it faces in the supply chain? and Would green-related practices a firm accepts or executes vary with the firm's position in the supply chain?															
AB Background: Poor mental health is a major issue worldwide and causality is complex. For diseases with multifactorial background synergistic effects of person-and place-factors can potentially be preventive. Nature is suggested as one such positive place-factor. In this cohort study we tested the effect of defined green qualities (Serene	 Space	 Wild	 Culture	 Lush) in the environment at baseline on mental health at follow-up. We also studied interaction effects on mental health of those place factors and varied person factors (financial stress	 living conditions	 and physical activity).										
AB Objective To study the risk environmental and psycho-social factors associated to prostate cancer (PCa) in Chinese population.																
AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been a developing topic for at least a couple of decades. Over this time	 significant complexities have been observed in its management. Helping to simplify and understand these complexities is necessary from both a practical and research perspective. Given this situation and to further enhance understanding of the topic and even supply chain management in general	 this paper develops and empirically tests a theoretical model on the different types of institutional pressures motivating manufacturing enterprises to pursue green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and commensurate performance outcomes. Using a sample of 396 Chinese manufacturers	 path analysis is used to evaluate the many structural links. The statistic results show that institutional pressures have driven the manufacturer adoption of internal GSCM practices which in turn relate to their external GSCM practices adoption. The statistic results also suggest that GSCM practices do not directly affect economic performance	 but can improve it indirectly. This research contributes to the literature on institutional theory in corporate environmental practices. The research findings provide useful insights for managers seeking to adopt GSCM practices. The results also provide policy insights for professional organizations	 regulators	 and legislators to further promote GSCM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.										
AB We examined the correlation between sputum colour and the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs).																
AB Objective: Rear-end accidents are the most common accident type at signalized intersections	 because the diversity of actions taken increases due to signal change. Green signal countdown devices (GSCDs)	 which have been widely installed in Asia	 are thought to have the potential of improving capacity and reducing accidents	 but some negative effects on intersection safety have been observed in practice; for example	 an increase in rear-end accidents.											
AB The purpose of this study was to examine food preferences of older adults living in the Black Belt Region of the Southeastern United States and the extent to which food preferences vary according to ethnicity	 gender	 and educational level. 270 older adults who were receiving home health services were interviewed in their home and were queried regarding their favorite foods. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Chi-square analysis or one-way analyses of variance was used	 where appropriate	 in bivariate analyses	 and logistic regression models were used in multivariate analyses. A total of 1	857 favorite foods were reported (mean per person = 6.88). The top ten favorite foods reported. included: (I) chicken (of any kind)	 (2) collard greens	 (3) cornbread	 (4) green or string beans	 (5) fish (fried catfish is implied)	 (6) turnip greens	 (7) potatoes	 (8) apples	 (9) tomatoes	 fried chicken	 and eggs tied
AB The purpose of this paper is to clarify some important issues as regards ship speed optimization at the operational level and develop models that optimize ship speed for a spectrum of routing scenarios in a single ship setting. The paper's main contribution is the incorporation of those fundamental parameters and other considerations that weigh heavily in a ship owner's or charterer's speed decision and in his routing decision	 wherever relevant. Various examples are given so as to illustrate the properties of the optimal solution and the various trade-offs that are involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.															
AB The history of development of winter wheat cultivation in five irrigation districts in northwestern Mexico is analyzed. The accelerated growth of winter wheat yields in northwestern Mexico can be described by adjustment of the parameters of the logistic model. A common variation in the analyzed series exists	 which is determined by the positive tendency of the series	 a product of the Green Revolution. This event explains 80% of the observed variation. Nevertheless	 social and economic conditions	 and regional geography	 suggest differential development. Four agricultural developments are defined: Borders (Mexicali-San Luis-Rio Colorado)	 Indigenous Agriculture (Ejidales Colonias Yaquis)	 private Agriculture (Valle del Yaqui and Mayo)	 and Pioneers (Valle de Santo Domingo in Baja California Sur). The development of each group is compared with the national efficiency curve. The purpose is to compare wheat yields in the main irrigated valleys of northwestern Mexico during the Green Revolution and the following stabilization	 based oil social and historic events. The possibility of increasing productivity as a function of the historic maximum reached at regional and national levels is discussed.							
AB Many companies are not dramatically changing to more sustainable environmental practices despite pressure from the investment community	 the government and consumers. This study explores a simple model that companies can use to understand and improve supply chain sustainability practices. It applies this model in two case studies	 Coca-Cola	 a leader in global sustainability	 and Apple	 a company that has only recently started to develop a sustainability strategy. The model was developed through a review of existing research and an application of supply chain principles. The results of this study demonstrate that following this model to eliminate waste throughout the supply chain will make the supply chain more profitable. The outcomes from this study highlight the importance for every company to do so in order to stay competitive. This study is unique in the relative simplicity of its model	 combined with the supporting evidence that a sustainable supply chain is the same as a supply chain that is using best practices to reduce waste.										
AB Background: Norovirus (NoV) is commonly associated with gastrointestinal infection. It is normally transmitted person-to-person or from contaminated surfaces	 although food-borne transmission is possible.															
AB The reverse logistics function in supply chain management has received increasing attention in recent years as the value of the activity	 the awareness of its potential and the legal requirements for its presence have increased. Reverse logistics has two dominant end purposes for returned materials-reconditioning (high-value recovery) or recycling (low to no value recovery). Much of the material generated by reverse logistics activity falls into this second category of low to no value. This can create a significant material management problem for many organisations. Several large organisations have successfully created recycling empires around the more primary materials that feed readily into raw material supply streams-such as metals	 timbers and paper. For individual firms	 however	 the likelihood of investing effort in identifying both materials that could be recycled and a potential market for them has seemed frequently out of reach. This study highlights an under-researched phenomenon whereby firms engage with one another to seek economical recycling of low value and often complex secondary materials. Using eight case studies of manufacturing firms	 the study identifies several examples of innovative and valuable recycling solutions occurring between supply chain members. Supply relationships are proposed to provide a critical enabler for improving firm knowledge of material value	 recycling options	 previously un-considered buyers or markets for a material	 and for aggregating resources and improving the economy of recycling.								
AB Many companies have begun to implement end-of-use strategies (remanufacturing	 recycling	 and reuse) in response to worldwide concern about environmental issues. Simultaneously	 academic research on remanufacturing has turned to focus on the analysis of activities from a supply perspective	 i.e.	 collection of end-of-use products	 reverse logistics	 disassembly	 assembly	 etc. Very little attention has been paid	 however	 to the demand side of remanufactured products	 in particular	 to the consumer profile of these products or to determining their most effective marketing strategies. Companies interested and involved in fostering the demand for remanufactured products need to be aware of the importance of knowledge of their potential consumers in order to most suitably manage their remanufacturing and marketing activities. Given this context	 the principal objective of the present work was to make a first approach to determining basics characteristics of the profile of potential consumers of remanufactured products. To this end	 an empirical analysis was conducted of the key variables underlying the purchase intentions of potential consumers in order to gain insight into the key drivers of that behavior. The instrument used was a questionnaire elaborated for application to potential consumers of a specific product (laptops) in two Spanish universities. The results revealed the drivers that explain the self-declared purchase intention of a remanufactured laptop	 and provide managers of firms interested in implementing green initiatives in their supply chain with useful information for their consideration of closed-loop supply chains and for integrating marketing decisions concerning remanufactured products into the development of end-of-use strategies.

AB Recent changes in environmental requirements have forced manufacturing operations to face a new challenge	 which is to develop green strategies to design supply chains and their processes. This study describes the specific features of green supply-chain design considering end-of-life products. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to obtain the optimal closed-loop supply-chain (CLSC) network design	 in which recovery process occurs in three different ways: material recovery	 component recovery	 and product recovery. An extensive analysis is supported by numerical results which inform CLSC managers about the opportunities of enhancing product returns in terms of quality and quantity. To define a better CLSC strategy to increase system profitability	 the volume of product returns and corresponding quality conditions should be considered in the design of a CLSC network. The numerical study provides information for us to discuss the potential benefits of product-recovery processes and the reaction of system profitability to the changes in specific CLSC parameters.											
AB Differences in plant community composition have been attributed to abiotic field characteristics	 crop type	 localized predation	 farm implement traffic	 and natural dispersal mechanisms. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates and herbicides also are known to influence weed community structure	 although their interaction has not been reported in the literature. A growth room experiment was conducted using three weed species (green foxtail	 redroot pigweed	 and velvetleaf) and five herbicides (nicosulfuron	 atrazine	 glufosinate	 glyphosate	 and mesotrione) differing in their mode of action and efficacy to the selected species. The experiment was conducted in growth chambers with two levels of N fertilization (low: 0.7 mM N and high: 7.7 mM N). Weeds were grown to the two- to five-leaf stage (depending on species)	 treated with the appropriate herbicide	 and harvested approximately 2 wk after treatment. The herbicide dose at which a 50% reduction in biomass occurred (GR(50)) was determined using log-logistic analysis. Herbicide susceptibility of the different weed species was influenced by N level. Green foxtail grown under low N required approximately six times the dose of nicosulfuron compared with plants grown under high N. Similarly	 higher doses of nicosulfuron	 glufosinate	 mesotrione
AB Establishment of reverse logistics (RL) networks for various original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) is gaining significant importance. Various green legislations are forcing OEMs; to take back their used	 end-of-lease or end-of-life products	 or products under warranty to minimize wastes and conserve resources. Therefore OEMs; have turned to a better design of their products for maximum reuse and recycling and to retrieve back the used products through a network for reuse	 remanufacture	 recycle or disposal	 so that maximum value can be achieved from their used products. However	 designing of network points and assigning capacities to them depend not only on the volume of returned products but also on the demand for remanufactured products and the parts of used products. If OEMs are not able to add value to the used product	 there would be no incentive to design a complex network.									
AB Evolution from unicellular organisms to larger multicellular ones requires matching their needs to the rate of exchange of molecular nutrients with the environment. This logistic problem poses a severe constraint on development. For organisms whose body plan is a spherical shell	 such as the volvocine green algae	 the current (molecules per second) of needed nutrients grows quadratically with radius	 whereas the rate at which diffusion alone exchanges molecules grows linearly	 leading to a bottleneck radius beyond which the diffusive current cannot meet metabolic demands. By using Volvox carteri	 we examine the role that advection of fluid by the coordinated beating of surface-mounted flagella plays in enhancing nutrient uptake and show that it generates a boundary layer of concentration of the diffusing solute. That concentration gradient produces an exchange rate that is quadratic in the radius	 as required	 thus circumventing the bottleneck and facilitating evolutionary transitions to multicellularity and germ-soma differentiation in the volvocalean green algae.									
AB Objective: To investigate associations between neighbourhood-level psychosocial stressors (i.e. experience of crime	 nuisance from neighbours	 drug misuse	 youngsters frequently hanging around	 rubbish on the streets	 feeling unsafe and dissatisfaction with the quality of green space) and self-rated health in Amsterdam	 the Netherlands.										
AB Background Pancreatic fistula continues to be a source of significant morbidity following distal pancreatic resections. The technique of pancreatic division varies widely among surgeons	 and there is no evidence that identifies a single method as superior. In our practice	 the technique of distal pancreatic resection has evolved from cut-and-sew to stapled technique with green and recently white cartridge. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of clinically significant fistulas [International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) grade B or C] following distal pancreatectomy and to identify variables associated with a low rate of fistula development.														
AB Aim: To investigate effects of green tea drinking and its temperature on esophageal cancer development. Methods: A 1:2 matched hospital-based case-control study including 150 cases and 300 controls was conducted in southern area of China from June 2004 to May 2010. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors of esophageal cancer	 and to assess the tea drinking habit and temperature. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We find a significant protective effect of high consumption of green tea on esophageal cancer with low temperature tea (OR=0.79	 95% CI=0.29-0.97). However	 drinking tea at a temperature of 70-79 degrees C and above 80 degrees C was related to greatly elevated risk of esophageal cancer with ORs of 2.21 (1.57-5.53) and 4.74 (2.67-10.51). An agreement was found between reported tea temperature and measured temperature (correlation coefficient =0.62). Further analysis indicated hot tea temperature to be associated with heavy risk of esophageal cancer in former and current smokers and current drinkers (former and current smokers: OR=8.91(1.91-16.77) and 7.33(2.23-12.46)	 respectively; former and current drinkers: OR=7.58(0.83-9.53) and 6.93(2.01-10.65)). Conclusion: In the South China context	 drinking tea at high temperature significantly increases risk of esophageal cancer	 especially in drinkers and smokers.										
AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the existing research and suggest potential opportunities for academic inquiry related to the concept of sustainable supply chain management.																
AB The increasing proportion of underweight young women may lead to an increase in those with low bone mass. The present study investigated whether bone mass level is associated with lifestyle factors among young Japanese women. A total of 103 Japanese female college students aged 20-21 majoring in food science participated in this cross-sectional study. We measured bone area ratio at the os calcis using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and assessed lifestyle factors including diet and physical activity using a self-reported questionnaire. Bone area ratio was defined as a proportion of bone substance in a cross section of os trabeculare. Ninety-one subjects who completed the questionnaire were categorized into two groups according to the average bone area ratio of the 103 subjects (30.9%)	 calculated based on the screening method for osteoporosis prevention: 69 subjects with normal bone mass (bone area ratio: 36.2 +/- 3.8%) and 22 subjects with low bone mass (bone area ratio: 28.1 +/- 1.6%). In normal group	 12 subjects (17.4%) had a dietary habit of not daily intake of green and yellow vegetables	 such as carrot and spinach	 while this occurred in 10 subjects (45.5%) in low group (P = 0.007). Adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that the subjects without daily intake of green and yellow vegetables had almost 5-fold risk of low bone mass	 compared to the subjects having daily intake of the vegetables [Odds ratio: 4.96 (95%CI 1.36-18.18)]. In conclusion	 daily intake of green and yellow vegetables is effective for maintaining bone mass in young women.										
AB The role of climatic fluctuations in determining the dynamics of insect populations has been a classical problem in population ecology. Here	 we use long-term annual data on green spruce aphid populations at nine localities in the UK for determining the importance of endogenous processes	 local weather and large-scale climatic factors. We rely on diagnostic and modelling tools from population dynamic theory to analyse these long-term data and to determine the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and local weather as exogenous factors influencing aphid dynamics. Our modelling suggests that the key elements determining population fluctuations in green spruce aphid populations in the UK are the strong non-linear feedback structure	 the high potential for population growth and the effects of winter and spring weather. The results indicate that the main effect of the NAO on green spruce aphid populations is operating through the effect of winter temperatures on the maximum per capita growth rate (R-m). In particular	 we can predict quite accurately the occurrence of an outbreak by using a simple logistic model with weather as a perturbation effect. However	 model predictions using different climatic variables showed a clear geographical signature. The NAO and winter temperature were best for predicting observed dynamics toward the southern localities	 while spring temperature was a much better predictor of aphid dynamics at northern localities. Although aphid species are characterized by complex life-cycles	 we emphasize the value of simple and general population dynamic models in predicting their dynamics.									
AB Background: The roles of several foods and beverages in the development of bladder cancer remain unclear.																
AB Owing to the revolution in sustainable and green manufacturing the production planning and network design of closed loop supply chain concept has got the attention of researchers and managers. In this paper	 a multi-product	 multi-facility capacitated closed-loop supply chain framework is proposed in an uncertain environment including reuse	 refurbish	 recycle and disposal of parts. The uncertainty related to demand	 fraction of parts recovered for different product recovery processes	 product acquisition cost	 purchasing cost	 transportation cost	 processing	 and set-up cost is handled with fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to decide optimally the location and allocation of parts at each facility and number of parts to be purchased from external suppliers in order to maximise the profit of organisation. The proposed solution methodology is able to generate a balanced solution between the feasibility degree and degree of satisfaction of the decision maker. The proposed model has been tested with an illustrative example.						
AB A global logistic model was used to study the effects of both quantitative variables (NaCl	 acid	 and potassium sorbate concentrations) and dummy variables (laboratory medium or brine	 and citric	 lactic	 or acetic acids) on growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IGAL01. The deduced equations	 with the significant coefficients selected by a backward stepwise procedure	 allowed estimations of the simultaneous comparison of behaviors of levels of the qualitative variables as a function of the quantitative variables and the development of the growth-no growth limits according to laboratory medium or brine and the different types of acidifying agents. The S. cerevisiae growth region in yeast malt glucose peptone broth was always wider than that in brine	 in which this yeast was inhibited by 0.03% potassium sorbate and 6% NaCl	 when the acid concentration (regardless of type) was 0.2 to 0.3%. These results demonstrate the applicability of such model designs to include qualitative variables in investigations related to the development of growth-no growth limits.							
AB The study was undertaken with the objectives to: (1) Study the present status of plastic waste management and the existing Phnom Penh household willingness and their influence factors to segregate plastics for recycling and reuse (plastics & non plastics); (2) Study how other cities encouraged and obtained the participation of their population in plastics recycling and reuse and (3) recommend which policy the government should implement plastic waste recycling in Phnom Penh. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase one involved secondary research such as reviewing of relevant literatures	 journals	 publications	 books	 and reports. The second phase involved collection of primary data via structured questionnaires. The study is analyzed based on 429 qualified questionnaires that were collected from households in Phnom Penh by using: percentage	 mean and standard deviation. It investigated household's behavior toward their waste and their willingness to separate plastics and non-plastics wastes. The researcher considers the question of waste from households as it is most likely the root of waste behaviors. By looking at the current state of process and recycling plastics waste - an important element of waste equation	 the researcher hopes to shed the lights on plastic waste issues.										
AB This article aims to analyse the introduction of environmental issues in the context of the production function	 which has been referred to as the organisational area to lead corporate environmental management. With that purpose	 the theoretical references for corporate environmental management and the necessary alterations in production function have been organised to include environmental aspects	 especially in terms of product and process development	 quality management	 and logistics. Considering that this research field still lacks empirical evidence for Brazilian companies	 four case studies were conducted using companies located in the country. The environmental management maturity level of those companies tends to follow the rate with which the environmental issue is introduced in production sub-areas	 especially in the product development process. However	 in most cases we found that the companies had difficulties in structuring the insertion of the environmental dimension in logistics. The final notes point out the distance observed between what is recommended by international literature and the reality of Brazilian companies in the challenge of making the production function environmentally friendly.								
AB Background and ObjectivesSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard method of determining regional lymph node involvement in cutaneous melanoma. Although traditionally performed via injection of radioisotope tracers and blue dyes	 fluorescent lymphangiography with indocyanine green (ICG) is an attractive alternative.															
AB Freshwater is a fundamental natural resource. It is essential for sustaining life	 supports the development of ecosystems and economies and is also used as a recreational resource. Therefore	 its appropriate management is critical if we want to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the supply. The aim of this paper is to analyze the main aspects influencing water saving in Spanish households. To accomplish this goal	 we start by developing a theoretical analysis of those aspects that affect water-saving behaviour. Following this theoretical approach	 an empirical analysis is developed. Such empirical research is based on developing several logistic regressions that include different water-saving behaviours as dependent variables.												
AB The paper develops an approach to the time-constrained	 multiple-stop	 truck-routing problem that minimizes the fuel consumption and pollutants emission. Features of framework are; it minimizes the distance a delivery vehicle must travel with a heavy payload in a given tour by sequencing the customer visits such that heavier items are unloaded first while lighter items are unloaded later	 and it considers the amount of fuel burned during the time a truck is detained at customer sites. Our simulations	 based on the routing of an actual motor carrier	 suggest the approach may produce up to 6.9% in fuel savings over existing methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Co-existence growth relationships were studied in communities consisting of a lipid-producing alga Chlorella sp. HQ	 another green alga and one cyanobacterium: I Scenedesmus obliquus and Microcystis aeruginosa; II Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Anabaena flos-aquae; III Selenastrum capricornutum and Microcystis wesenbergii. The cyanobacteria and green algae except for Chlorella sp. HQ were commonly detected in Chinese reservoir and wastewater. The rate of increase of apparent cell number difference with other algae (k (app))	 inhibition/stimulation ratio (ISR) and the parameters of logistic model and co-existence model were determined for Chlorella. Chlorella strains were the most competitive in Combination I	 and were stimulated during 75% of the cultivation time for all three combinations. Anabaena growth exceeded those of Chlorella and Chlamydomonas on the 5th cultivation day under 1 : 1 : 1 inoculum ratio. Scenedesmus colonies consisted of fewer cells	 whose average length significantly shortened after the 5th cultivation day under 1 : 1 : 1 inoculum ratio. The developed co-existence model can identify the concrete growth inhibitor or stimulator among three species compared with the single method of cell number monitoring. Good correlation was found between transformed and non-transformed co-existence model through a (mn) and b (mn) values. Allelopathy and nutrient competition are both possible mechanisms in the above growth relationships.												
AB This paper focuses on evaluating the economic potential and infrastructure requirements of hydrogen production from agricultural residues	 a representative green energy pathway. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is constructed for finding the most efficient and economical configuration of the whole pathway. Using northern California case studies	 we found that hydrogen from agricultural wastes can be delivered at costs similar to producing hydrogen from natural gas	 a non-renewable energy source. The potential impact of this energy pathway on local freight transport is also discussed depending on the choice of hydrogen delivery mode. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.													
AB The availability of urban green space (UGS) is one of the environmental factors that is frequently linked to increased levels of physical activity (PA). Positive associations with increased levels of PA are reported for the amount of UGS close to home	 the distance to the nearest UGS	 the size of the nearest UGS	 and the presence of certain features. However	 the evidence to date is somewhat inconclusive	 and dominated by studies from North America and Australia. There is a large variation in city structures	 and recommendations for North American or Australian cities are not automatically valid for European cities. Using a sample of 1305 Danish adults and detailed descriptions of UGS	 we examined the association between UGS and outdoor PA in general	 as well as PA in the nearest UGS. No association between outdoor PA in general	 size of	 distance to	 and number of features in the nearest UGS was found. The amount and number of UGS within 1 km revealed no association either. For PA in the nearest UGS positive associations with size	 walking/cycling routes	 wooded areas	 water features	 lights	 pleasant views
AB This paper introduces new environmental constraints	 namely carbon emission constraints	 in multi-sourcing lot-sizing problems. These constraints aim at limiting the carbon emission per unit of product supplied with different modes. A mode corresponds to the combination of a production facility and a transportation mode and is characterized by its economical costs and its unitary carbon emission. Four types of constraints are proposed and analyzed in the single-item uncapacitated lot-sizing problem. The periodic case is shown to be polynomially solvable	 while the cumulative	 global and rolling cases are NP-hard. Perspectives to extend this work are discussed. (C) B.VElsevier B.V.

AB Background: Socio-ecological models suggest that both individual and neighborhood characteristics contribute to facilitating health-enhancing behaviors such as physical activity. Few European studies have explored relationships between local built environmental characteristics	 recreational walking and cycling and weight status in adults. The aim of this study was to identify built environmental patterns in a French urban context and to assess associations with recreational walking and cycling behaviors as performed by middle-aged adult residents.															
AB No prediction rule is currently available for advanced colorectal neoplasms	 defined as invasive cancer	 an adenoma of 10 mm or more	 a villous adenoma	 or an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia	 in average-risk Chinese. In this study between 2006 and 2008	 a total of 7	541 average-risk Chinese persons aged 40 years or older who had complete colonoscopy were included. The derivation and validation cohorts consisted of 5	229 and 2	312 persons	 respectively. A prediction rule was developed from a logistic regression model and then internally and externally validated. The prediction rule comprised 8 variables (age	 sex	 smoking	 diabetes mellitus	 green vegetables	 pickled food	 fried food
AB Background: There are several synergistic methods available. However	 there is a vast discrepancy in the interpretation of the synergistic results. Also	 these synergistic methods do not assess the influence the tested components (drugs	 plant and natural extracts)	 have upon one another	 when more than two components are combined.											
AB More than 300 papers have been published in the last 15 years on the topic of green or sustainable (forward) supply chains. Looking at the research methodologies employed	 only 36 papers apply quantitative models. This is in contrast to	 for example	 the neighboring field of reverse or closed-loop supply chains where several reviews on respective quantitative models have already been provided. The paper summarizes research on quantitative models for forward supply chains and thereby contributes to the further substantiation of the field. While different kinds of models are applied	 it is evident that the social side of sustainability is not taken into account. On the environmental side	 life-cycle assessment based approaches and impact criteria clearly dominate. On the modeling side there are three dominant approaches: equilibrium models	 multi-criteria decision making and analytical hierarchy process. There has been only limited empirical research so far. The paper ends with suggestions for future research. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphical models are used to describe the conditional independence relations in multivariate data. They have been used for a variety of problems	 including log-linear models (Liu and Massam	 2006)	 network analysis (Holland and Leinhardt	 1981; Strauss and Ikeda	 1990; Wasserman and Pattison 1996; Pattison and Wasserman	 1999; Robins et al.	 1999)	 graphical Gaussian models (Roverato and Whittaker	 1998; Giudici and Green	 1999; Marrelec and Benali	 2006)	 and genetics (Dobra et al.	 2004). A distribution that satisfies the conditional independence structure of a graph is	Markov. A graphical model is a family of distributions that is restricted to be Markov with respect to a certain graph. In a Bayesian problem	 one may specify a prior over the graphical model. Such a prior is called a hyper Markov law if the random marginals also satisfy the independence constraints. Previous work in this area includes (Dempster	 1972; Dawid and Lauritzen
AB This study presents insights into the determinants of tourists' intention to pay a premium for accommodation in a hotel with renewable energy sources. The empirical analysis is based on the estimation of binary logistic regression models. Four subsets of independent variables were used in this empirical analysis	 namely: (i) demographic factors	 (ii) economic variables	 (iii) past experience with regard to renewable energy sources	 and (iv) variables regarding environmental awareness and information dissemination. Empirical results suggest that middle-aged people are probably more willing to pay for their stay in a hotel using renewable energy. In general	" men are more likely than women to pay extra money for accommodation in a ""green"" hotel. However"	 the results suggest that marital status and educational level are not statistically significant factors in the willingness to pay more. Rather	 environmentally-conscious and adequately informed tourists are more willing to pay for renewable energy than others. Our analysis is focused on intention because we expect that those people willing to pay for staying in a green hotel are a potentially relevant market segment for developing sustainable tourism in Greece.

AB This paper proposed a sustainability balanced scorecard (SBSC) framework to measure the sustainable performance of the semiconductor industry. Based on the principle of four perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC)	 of which two were changed from the financial and customer perspectives to sustainability and stakeholder perspectives to deal the insufficiently addressed issue of corporate social responsibility. Twenty-five measures of sustainable performance were recognized through expert questionnaires and through the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Further	 the relative weights of the selected measures were determined using the analytic network process (ANP). Results indicated that the five most important measures of sustainable performance were profitability (0.2528)	 green innovation and investment (0.1563)	 green image (0.1546)	 customer satisfaction (0.0799)	 and sustainability awareness of the top management (0.0516). Among these measures	 the top three all belonged to the sustainability perspective	 which comprised 56% of the overall weighting. The proposed SBSC framework can help Taiwanese semiconductor companies enhance their competitiveness in terms of sustainable operations is anticipated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Red Cross Hospital is a medium-sized general hospital with 385 beds	 located in Beverwijk	 The Netherlands. It also has a freestanding National Burn Care Centre. The Red Cross Hospital was the first hospital in The Netherlands with a quality system based on ISO 9000. At the end of 2001 the hospital started implementing Six Sigma. The process began with Executive Training for management and Green Belt (GB) training for 16 middle managers and other staff. Seven GB projects were started in the areas of accounts receivable	 patient logistics	 invoicing	 medication	 temporary workers	 and length of stay in hospital. In February 2003 the final review of the first group was done and savings appeared to be three times higher than estimated beforehand. At present (May 2004) the fourth group of Green Belts has been trained. In this paper we briefly explain that Six Sigma was the next logical step in the quality approach of the hospital. We also discuss how it was implemented and we describe some case studies in the nursing departments. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons	 Ltd.								
AB We develop and analyze an economic model of remanufacturing to address two main research questions. First	 we explore which market	 cost	 and product type conditions induce a profit-maximizing firm to be a remanufacturer	 given a separate (secondary) remanufactured goods market. Such markets exist for consumer goods	" where ""newness"" is a differentiating factor. Second"	 we describe what effect profitable remanufacturing has on the environment. Our stylized modeling framework for analyzing these issues incorporates three components: lease contracting	 product design	 and remanufacturing volume. To operationalize this framework	 we model and solve for the optimal decisions of two firm types: a non-remanufacturer	 which we call a traditional firm	 and a remanufacturer	 which we call a green firm. We describe conditions under which remanufacturing is (and is not) profitable	 and demonstrate that under certain cost and market conditions remanufacturing has negative consequences for the environment. Our results have implications for firms and policy makers who would like to choose remanufacturing as a strategy to improve profitability and environmental performance	 given the existence of conditions under which neither might occur.

AB This paper proposes a bit-level permutation and high-dimension chaotic map to encrypt color image. Firstly	 convert the plain color image of size (MxN) into a grayscale image of size (Mx3N)	 then transform it into a binary matrix	 and permute the matrix at bit-level by the scrambling mapping generated by piecewise linear chaotic map (PWLCM). Secondly	 use Chen system to confuse and diffuse the red	 green and blue components simultaneously. Experiment results and security analysis not only show that the scheme can achieve good encryption result	 but also that the key space is large enough to resist against common attack.

AB Count data are often used to assess relative population size and population trends with sufficient power and confidence for wildlife population studies	 including those for nesting sea turtles. Although access to sea turtles while nesting is relatively simple compared to many other migratory marine animals	 optimal surveys tagging every individual through the nesting season are often not feasible due to time	 financial and other logistic constraints. Partial survey counts can then be used to estimate population abundance. Several models have previously been published describing the seasonal shape in abundance for nesting turtles	 but none have compared different model fits using a numerical approach and all have limited general application as they describe only 1 location or 1 species. We compared 22 non-parametric and parametric modelling approaches for 9 populations of sea turtles comprising 3 different species: green sea turtles Chelonia mydas	 loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta and leatherback sea turtles Dermochelys coriacea. Although models showed marked differences in the shape of their fit	 all models provided reasonable estimates of annual nesting abundance	 with mean errors less than 8% for 50% data coverage and mostly 8 to 10% for 20% random coverage. Of the 3 models that produced significantly lower mean absolute error	 we recommend using generalized additive models to estimate annual abundance due to their ease of fitting	 flexibility across populations and seasonal shapes and their good predictive ability.							
AB We studied growth in the Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus)	 a small Neotropical parrotlet that has an unusually long nestling period (28-35 days) and feeds nestlings nutritionally poor seeds. We asked why nestlings grow slowly even though nest predation is their main mortality factor. We examined nutrient accretion and the development of thermoregulation and computed an energy budget until fledging. We described three periods of growth: (1) days 1-13	 when peak accretion for sodium	 lipids	 and energy occurred; (2) days 14-22	 when nestlings became endothermic and accretion for proteins	 calcium	 and phosphorus peaked; and (3) days 23-30	 when nestlings reached 90% of the asymptotic values of body components. The deposition rate of lipids (logistic constant K = 0.33) was higher than that of protein (K = 0.19)	 ash and calcium (K = 0.20)	 and	 particularly	 phosphorus (K = 0.14). In concordance with their slow growth	 nestlings became endothermic only 10 days before fledging	 considerably later than expected from asymptotic mass. Total metabolized energy during the nestling period was 1	133.3 kJ	 of which 59.2% accounted for resting metabolic rate and 26.2% for activity. Growth efficiency
AB Background: It is difficult to predict hepatic functional reserve accurately before major hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to analyse the usefulness of the future liver remnant plasma clearance rate of indocyanine green (ICGK-F	 calculated as plasma clearance rate of indocyanine green (ICGK) x proportion of the future liver remnant) in predicting death after major hepatectomy.															
AB Over the past decade	 there has been an increasing interest in product take-back	 product recovery and the (re-)distribution of these products. The automotive sector	 in particular	 has a strong history of product recovery operations	 such as remanufacturing. Alongside this development	 an academic interest in the management of re-use	 recycling or remanufacturing has evolved and developed into the field of closed-loop supply chain management. Closed-loop supply chain management	 however	 is only characterised by a short research history	 the earliest contributions can be found on reverse logistics and were published in the early 1990s. Due to the novelty of the field there are still a large number of unsolved research problems. One of these is the question for the rationale behind product recovery operations. This research is based on in-depth case studies within the remanufacturing facilities of a major European Vehicle Manufacturer. The article examines whether the 'classic' motives for product recovery are applicable to automotive remanufacturing. It concludes with a summary of the contributions this research makes to theory	 to industry and to future research in the field. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research on green supply chain management (GSCM) or sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has attracted increased attention in recent years. Although GSCM/SSCM has been studied for developed and developing countries	 there has been little information about the adoption of GSCM/SSCM practices in India. This article presents one of the earliest surveys on GSCM practices in Indian manufacturing firms. The items for the survey were developed based on the extant literature and feedback from corporates. Some of the major findings of the survey are as follows. We found that the state of adoption of GSCM practices by Indian firms was still in its infancy	 the awareness of environmental sustainability was quite low among consumers	 and the regulatory framework was also lacking in terms of promoting environmental sustainability. Results of data analysis showed that supplier collaboration for environmental sustainability had a positive impact on environmentally sustainable product design and logistics	 which in turn was positively related to competitiveness and economic performance of the firm. We compared the results with the observations made by other researchers for developed and developing countries and provided managerial implications for the government and manufacturers as to what steps need to be taken to generate awareness towards environmental sustainability and facilitate the adoption of GSCM practices among Indian firms to a greater extent. We conclude the paper by indicating directions for future research on GSCM/SSCM.												
AB With increased outsourcing and environmental consciousness	 this paper presents an analytic network process (ANP) approach to incorporate the issue of hazardous substance management (HSM) into supplier selection. In this study	 identification of criteria of HSM competence is categorized into four dimensions	 a multi-criteria decision model is proposed. ANP is then applied to supplier selection and is characterized by interdependencies among decision structure components. An illustrative example in an electronics company is presented to demonstrate how to select a most appropriate supplier in accordance with the requirements of hazardous substance for environmental regulations.

AB Vegetable and fruit intake has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer and CVD	 but its relationship to the risk of type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We prospectively examined the association between vegetable and fruit intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Subjects were 21 269 men and 27 168 women aged 45-75 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study and had no history of type 2 diabetes or other serious diseases. Intake of vegetables and fruit was estimated using a validated 147-item FFQ. The OR of self-reported	 physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5 years was estimated using multiple logistic regression. A total of 896 newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. Intake of vegetables and fruit combined or fruit only was not associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. However	 there was an approximately 20 %	 albeit not statistically significant	 risk reduction associated with vegetables (men only)	 green leafy vegetables (men and women) and cruciferous vegetables (men only). Such risk reduction was somewhat greater among obese or smoking men than non-obese or non-smoking men. In conclusion	 although a small beneficial effect of vegetables	 especially green leafy and cruciferous vegetables	 cannot be excluded	 vegetable and fruit intake may not be appreciably associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes for Japanese adults.						
AB Environmental management and economic concerns drive the remanufacturing industry to inevitable process in closed loop logistics. The collection of end-of-life products from end-users is a main issue as their amounts will directly affect the inventory of manufacturing units	 with a significant impact on the final product cost and green environment. Most of the existing models on reverse logistics assumed the return rate as a fixed fraction. However	 the number of returned products is always uncertain and depends on many factors like law	 government policy	 environmental protection issues	 etc. The presented research overcomes this limitation and formulates a mathematical model in which the return rate will be a function of environmental factors. Moreover	 the model is extended by integrating it with state-of-the-art radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. This RFID embedded model is aimed at mapping the economical merits by easily counting returned products and transferring them to different remanufacturing centres. In order to meet the objective of the proposed model	 a superiority search and optimisation algorithm (SSOA) has been proposed. The novel approach efficiently predicts and selects a superior algorithm from a given set of algorithms	 and adequately explores the entire search space to achieve superior performance on the underlying problem. Furthermore	 the results obtained by implementing the proposed SSOA have been analysed and compared with other random search techniques including genetic algorithm (GA)	 simulated annealing (SA)	 and particle swarm optimisation (PSO). The proposed SSOA approach was seen to significantly outperform the rest.					
AB This paper identifies research opportunities which will enable the further integration of inland waterway transport in the intermodal supply chain. Intermodal transport may be interpreted as a chain of actors who supply a transport service. Inland navigation can play a crucial role in increasing supply chain service performance. A first group of research challenges lies in the evolving relationship between transport geography and logistics activities. The next set of research challenges has the objective to encourage efficient operations in IWT: development of a system wide model for IWT	 integration of operational planning systems and analysis of bundling networks. A third group of research efforts is directed towards shippers and consignees who use the intermodal transport chain to send or receive their goods: further development of models that integrate intermodal transport decisions with supply chain decisions and creation of green supply chains. A fourth cluster of research challenges concerns the problem domain of external cost calculations. Finally detailed time series data on freight transport should be collected to support these future research tracks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.															
AB This article considers how adopting an environmentally sustainable agenda impacts on the management of an organisation's supply chain and highlights areas for future research. The article argues that the current fragmented/functional approach to sustainability and the conceptualisation of the supply chain as a bounded unidirectional flow of value does not provide the holistic approach that is required to meet the sustainability needs of tomorrow's business. A value cycle paradigm that facilitates the development of a multi-disciplinary research approach is developed and used to examine the extant literature for the principal issues that will need to be addressed. Future research concerned with developing environmentally sustainable business models must focus on the identification and management of the information flows at the interfaces between the customer	 marketing	 design	 operations	 logistics and external agents in the supply network. New networks required to support more sustainable forms of consumption will necessitate a fundamental reassessment of how and where value is added	 consumed and recovered. In contemporary businesses	 environmental sustainability is becoming a strategically important objective requiring holistic multi-disciplinary approaches. The extent to which the sustainability agenda extends conventional business models is demonstrated providing insights into areas of the value cycle that require further research.										
AB The aim of the study was to determine a growth rate of Salmonella Enteritidis in cooked ham stored under different temperatures and to compare usefulness of the mathematical models for describing the microbiological data. The samples of cooked pork ham were inoculated with the mixture of three Salmonella Enteritidis strains and stored at 5 degrees C	 10 degrees C	 15 degrees C for 21 d	 and at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C for 5 d. The number of salmonellae was determined at 10 periods of storage at each temperature. From each sample a series of decimal dilutions were prepared and plated onto Brilliant Green Agar. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24-48 h under aerobic conditions. The colonies grown on culture media were counted	 bacterial counts were multiplied by the appropriate dilutions	 and number of bacteria (colony-forming units) was calculated. The bacterial counts were transformed into logarithms and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20. The experiment was performed in five replicates. The obtained growth curves of bacteria were fitted to primary growth models	 namely Gompertz	 logistic	 and Baranyi models. The goodness-of-fit test was evaluated by calculating mean square error and Akaike's criterion. Growth kinetics values from the modified Gompertz and logistic equations were calculated. It was found that in samples of ham stored at 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C for 21 d	 the number of bacteria remained almost at the same level during storage. In samples stored at 15 degrees C	 20 degrees C	 and 25 degrees C growth of salmonellae was observed. It was found that logistic model gave in most cases the best fit to obtained microbiological data describing the behaviour of S. Enteritidis in cooked ham. The growth kinetics values calculated in this study from logistic equations can be used to predict potential S. Enteritidis growth in cooked ham stored at 15 degrees C	 20 degrees C	 and 25 degrees C.			
AB In herbicide-selectivity experiments	 response can be measured by visual inspection	 stand counts	 plant mortality	 and biomass. Some response types are relative to nontreated control. We developed a nondestructive method by analyzing digital color images to quantify color changes in leaves caused by herbicides. The range of color components of green and nongreen parts of the plants and soil in Hue	 Saturation	 and Brightness (HSB) color space were used for segmentation. The canopy color changes of barley	 winter wheat	 red fescue	 and brome fescue caused by doses of a glyphosate and diflufenican mixture	 cycloxydim	 diquat dibromide	 and fluazifop-p-butyl were described with a log-logistic dose-response model	 and the relationship between visual inspection and image analysis was calculated at the effective doses that cause 50% and 90% response (ED50 and ED90	 respectively). The ranges of HSB components for the green and nongreen parts of the plants and soil were different. The relative potencies were not significantly different from one	 indicating that visual and image analysis estimations were about the same. The comparison results suggest that image analysis can be used to assess color changes of plants in response to some herbicides and may have the potential to provide an objective measurement of symptoms.	
AB Profiling of volatiles from pineapple fruits was performed at four ripening stages using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS). In total	 142 volatiles were detected	 of which 132 were identified. Multivariate data analysis was carried out to assess the effect of post-harvest storage on volatiles composition of green-ripe sea-freighted pineapple in comparison to air-freighted fruits harvested at full maturity. The latter fruits were characterised by volatiles described as potent odorants in pineapples	 such as delta-octalactone	 gamma-lactones	 1-(E	Z)-3	5-undecatriene and 1	3	5	8-undecatetraene	 as well as various methyl esters. In contrast	 post-harvest storage of green-ripe sea-freighted fruits resulted in an increased formation of ethyl esters	 acetates	 acetoxy esters and alcohols	 thus allowing the authentication of sea- and air-freighted pineapples	 respectively. Particularly
AB Academic and corporate interest in Sustainable supply chain management has risen considerably in recent years. This can be seen by the number of papers published and in particular by journal special issues. To establish the field further	 the purpose of this paper is twofold. First	 it offers a literature review on sustainable supply chain management taking 191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. Second	 it offers a conceptual framework to summarize the research in this field comprising three parts. As starting point related triggers are identified. This allows putting forward two distinct strategies: (1) supplier management for risks and performance	 and (2) Supply chain management for sustainable products. it is evident that research is still dominated by green/environmental issues. Social aspects and also the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability are still rare. Both practitioners in companies and academics might find the review useful	 as it outlines major lines of research in the field. Further	 it discusses specific features of sustainable supply chains as well as limitations of existing research; this should stimulate further research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Concerns about industrial and supply chain implications on our natural environment have existed for decades. Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have caused countries to implement various instruments ranging from taxes	 permits and voluntary incentives to required regulatory policies. Given this environment	 we develop a unified optimization model for a closed-loop supply chain in which the carbon emission is expressed in terms of dollar carbon cost. This study is one of the first to evaluate the forward and reverse supply chain influences on the carbon footprint. A comparative analysis is completed with a decomposition of cost and environmental influences across supply chain functions. We utilize data from a company located in Australia	 where the government is currently introducing a carbon pricing scheme. We find that variations in cost and environmental impacts occur over ranges of carbon pricing. Characteristics and patterns of the numerical results over these ranges provide insights for corporate key strategies and potential additional government policies. These results and implications are analyzed along with limitations and directions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.													
AB This paper explores the external costs of domestic container transportation in Taiwan by analysing the origin and destination of current container cargoes. After reviewing an extensive literature survey of methods of external cost	 a comparison of external costs between trucking and short sea shipping (SSS) by corridor is made by using a model developed in this paper. Based on the findings that external costs of SSS are considerably lower than truck transport and can be a viable alternative to current domestic container cargo transportation	 we discuss the significance and managerial implications of SSS from the perspective of green logistics. In so doing	 a top-down approach is employed for developing government policies	 which aim to not only reduce the external costs of domestic container transportation but also promote SSS in Taiwan.												
AB Reasons for performing study: Lyophilised products from green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus[LPPC]) are used to orally treat horses with osteoarthritis (OA). However	 no randomised	 controlled or double-blinded studies on the efficacy of this treatment in horses have been reported to date. Objective: To investigate the effects of a unique LPPC (Biolane) in improving clinical signs of OA in the fetlock. Methods: Data were analysed from 26 horses with primary fetlock lameness in a controlled	 randomised and double-blinded	 multi-centre clinical trial. The study design was a partial crossover with a washout period and consisted of 19 horses treated with LPPC and 20 with a placebo. Horses were dosed orally with 25 mg/kg bwt/day LPPC or placebo for 56 days. Efficacy was evaluated by clinical assessment of lameness	 passive flexion	 pain	 swelling and heat in the affected joint. Relationships between variables were analysed using an ordinal logistic model with random effects for horse and horse x treatment according to a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Clinical evaluation of horses with a fetlock lameness treated with LPPC showed a significant reduction in severity of lameness (P<0.001)	 improved response to the joint flexion test (P<0.001) and reduced joint pain (P = 0.014) when compared with horses treated with placebo. Conclusions: The LPPC significantly alleviated the severity of lameness and joint pain and improved response to joint flexion in horses with lameness attributable to OA in the fetlock.								
AB This study is concerned with the implications of changing latitudinal gradients in vegetative phenology (green-up	 senescence	 and length of growing season) for the management of long-distance seasonal movements of livestock herds in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa. For a study area covering much of the southern half of Mali	 phenological parameters were estimated using a double-logistic function fitted to seasonal NDVI trajectories for 1 km(2) MODIS data over the period 2000-2010. Green-up dates	 senescence dates and length of growing season were all found to more strongly vary by latitude (+9 days/degree	 5 days/degree and -14 days/degree	 respectively) than across years (+0.42 days/year	 +0.86 days/year and +0.44 days/year respectively). Interannual and spatial variability of these parameters are highest at lower latitudes within the study area. The slopes of the relationship of phenological parameters with latitude change across the latitudinal range studied. Breakpoint analysis of annual green-up versus latitude curves identifies a mean inflection point of 13 degrees north latitude above which the positive slope declines significantly. This previously-undescribed pattern is consistent with recent work on monsoonal dynamics showing rainfall onset being associated with an abrupt shift in the location of the ITCZ (monsoon onset) at latitudes north of 13 degrees north latitude. The effects of the observed variation in latitudinal gradients of phenological variables on the direction and timing of regional livestock movements are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background and Purpose-Although experimental studies have suggested that tea consumption may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke	 available epidemiological evidence is equivocal	 mainly due to the lack of accurate measurements on tea exposure. This study aims to ascertain the relationship between tea drinking and ischemic stroke risk.														
AB In this article	 we study a biobjective economic lot-sizing problem with applications	 among others	 in green logistics. The first objective aims to minimize the total lot-sizing costs including production and inventory holding costs	 whereas the second one minimizes the maximum production and inventory block expenditure. We derive (almost) tight complexity results for the Pareto efficient outcome problem under nonspeculative lot-sizing costs. First	 we identify nontrivial problem classes for which this problem is polynomially solvable. Second	 if we relax any of the parameter assumptions	 we show that (except for one case) finding a single Pareto efficient outcome is an NP-hard task in general. Finally	 we shed some light on the task of describing the Pareto frontier. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals	 Inc.							
AB The plant bug Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dur) is a major pest on Bt cotton and multiple crops in northern China. A modified NI artificial diet called T7 was developed to rear this pest for 10 successive generations both individually and in groups. This T7 diet was similar in components and preparation process to the NI diet used for Lygus hesperus in North America	 but was comprised of more whole chicken eggs	 soybean lecithin	 and Vanderzant vitamin mixture	 and less brewerOs yeast	 wheat germ	 lima bean meal	 soy flour	 and sugars than NI diet. While being reared individually on T7 diet	 A. lucorum nymphs had a developmental duration of approximate to 12 d and survival rate of approximate to 80%	 which was not significantly different from that on green beans. While being reared in groups	 nymphal survival rate was above 81% (indeed above 90% for the first four generations)	 the weight of adults was heavier than on green beans and the average fecundity had a logistic increase through generations. The replacement rate of A. lucorum populations was expected to be approximate to 29 times per generation while being reared at a density of 100 nymphs per box (20 x 12 x 7 cm). This is the first successful artificial diet reported for rearing A. lucorum and is superior to green beans. The diet offers an economic means for producing natural enemies for biological control of this pest on Bt cotton. The possibility of further improvement of the present artificial diet is also discussed.				
AB In the 5 years since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast	 scholars in many disciplines have speculated on the sources of the widespread devastation. While many of these studies have focused on objective evidence of the violation of human rights following Hurricane Katrina	 this study reviews the human rights violations and goes a step further by examining social audience reactions (both victims and the general public) to the government's response efforts. Relying on Green and Ward's (Green 2009; Green and Ward Social Justice	 27	 101-115	 2000; 2004) human rights/organizational deviance definition	 which sees state crime as human rights violations that result from state organizational deviance	 we attempt to provide further evidence of this case as one of state crime. This article presents results from binary logistic regression analyses that assess the likelihood of respondents disapproving of the actions of officials from various levels of government after the hurricane using data from a survey of Hurricane Katrina evacuees completed by The Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University (The Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University 2005) in the weeks after the storm	 and data from a special topics ABC News/Washington Post public opinion survey completed in September of 2005 (ABC News/The Washington Post 2006). Key findings in this study include a strong similarity of results across data sets for race	 sex	 and religion with regards to respondents disapproving responses to the storm devastation at the federal level. A clear majority of respondents in both data sets disapproved of the actions of some level of government	 further implying negative audience reactions	 and thus the need to recognize the government's response to Hurricane Katrina as a state crime.				
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between neighbourhood greenspace and weight status	 and to explore the contribution of physical activity to these associations.															
AB The leisure sector in Chinese cities has flourished in recent years. Lacking leisure studies could compromise resource supply and management. We explored urban residents' participation in twenty-five leisure activities in Zhuhai	 a newly developed city in south China. Leisure activities were classified into four groups based on consumption venue (intrahome and extrahome) and physical activities (passive and active). A face-to-face questionnaire survey included 850 households in seventy residential precincts chosen by a clustered sampling scheme	 generating 598 valid questionnaires. Responses were solicited on participation level on weekdays and holidays	 leisure time	 leisure companions	 leisure barriers	 use of urban green spaces	 and respondents' socioeconomic profile. Multiple and logistic regressions were computed. Intrahome activities have higher participation rates than extrahome activities	 and passive notably higher than active. The weekday leisure pattern is similar to holiday patterns despite more leisure time. Watching television	 chatting with families or friends	 and leisure reading are premier intrahome activities. Walking for leisure and shopping are the main extrahome engagements. Intrahome activities are more prominent among urban-based	 homebound	 passive-oriented	 sedentary	 and individualistic noninteractive types	 with health implications. Middle-aged residents have less leisure time vis-a-vis young adults. Shortage of leisure resources and poor recreation venue management have created critical participation barriers. Residents prefer conveniently located and semiprivate neighborhood gardens embedded within residential developments rather than public sites. Young residents prefer to use urban parks	 whereas middle-age and older residents prefer local sites. Cleanliness and other quality attributes are rated as key determinants for visiting green spaces. The results could inform future policies on leisure development in new Chinese cities.
AB Diet is a potentially modifiable risk factor for Barrett's esophagus (BE). We investigated the associations between intakes of fruits and vegetables and risk of BE.																
AB Sustainability	 the consideration of environmental factors and social aspects	 in supply chain management (SCM) has become a highly relevant topic for researchers and practitioners. The application of operations research methods and related models	 i.e. formal modeling	 for closed-loop SCM and reverse logistics has been effectively reviewed in previously published research. This situation is in contrast to the understanding and review of mathematical models that focus on environmental or social factors in forward supply chains (SC)	 which has seen less investigation. To evaluate developments and directions of this research area	 this paper provides a content analysis of 134 carefully identified papers on quantitative	 formal models that address sustainability aspects in the forward SC. It was found that a preponderance of the publications and models appeared in a limited set of six journals	 and most were analytically based with a focus on multiple criteria decision making. The tools most often used comprise the analytical hierarchy process or its close relative	 the analytical network process	 as well as life cycle analysis. Conclusions are drawn showing that numerous possibilities and insights can be gained from expanding the types of tools and factors considered in formal modeling efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB More and more companies are paying attention to their carbon footprint beyond production emissions. In this work we consider a 'carbon-aware' company (either by choice or enforced by regulation) that is reconsidering the transport mode selection decision. Traditionally the trade-off has been between lead time (and corresponding inventory costs) and transportation costs but now emission costs come into the equation. We use a carbon emission measurement methodology based on real-life data and incorporate it into an inventory model. We consider the results for different types of emission regulation (including voluntary targets). We find that even though large emission reductions can be obtained by switching to a different mode	 the actual decision depends on the regulation and non-monetary considerations	 such as lead time variability.														
AB The purpose of this study was to explore the spatial relationship between park availability and chronic health conditions (CHCs) across age groups in Kansas City	 MO. Multinomial logistic regression examined the association between having a park within one-half mile from home and the likelihood of having 0	1	 or 2 or more CHCs. Among respondents aged 40-59	 those without a park within one-half mile from home were more than twice as likely to have 2 or more CHCs compared to respondents that had a park nearby. Parks may be an important protective factor for chronic diseases	 especially among middle-aged adults among whom access to neighborhood recreational environments may be particularly important.

AB The functional responses of each instar larva and adult of the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis to adults of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae were estimated under laboratory conditions. Linear parameter estimates from a logistic model of the proportion of M. persicae consumed by H. axyridis were negative at all development stages. Although a realistic estimate for the handling time of first instar larvae could not be produced	 functional response curves of fitting the data with a random predator equation exhibited a Type II curve in most development stages. Fourth instar larva had the highest attack rate and shortest prey handling tune. The implications of these results are discussed with more effective stages of H. axyridis in the context of biological control.															
AB Consideration is given to the convergence of supply chains and sustainability. In doing so	 the focus on environmental management and operations is moved from local optimization of environmental factors to consideration of the entire supply chain during the production	 consumption	 customer service and post-disposal disposition of products. This is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over sustainability	 whether driven by current legislation	 public interest	 or competitive opportunity. As such	 sustainable development is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has the potential to affect future government policy	 current production operations	 and identify new business models. This paper provides a background to better understand current trends in this multidisciplinary field that intersect with operations management	 and the research opportunities and challenges it presents.

AB The navigation distance via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) from a Northwest-European port to the Far East is approximately 40% shorter compared to the route via the Suez Canal. The shorter distance may facilitate more than a doubling of vessels' operational energy efficiency performance. There is at present substantial uncertainty in schedule reliability via the NSR. Unless the schedule reliability is improved	 the NSR should primarily be explored for bulk rather than for liner shipping. A major disadvantage with the NSR is its seasonality. Shipping operations in the summer time via the NSR may already today be profitable for minor bulk trades. Additional shipping routes may give more flexibility	 and the NSR route choice option may facilitate supply chain agility and adaptability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.														
AB The nest-site requirements of the great bittern Botaurus stellaris females in relation to habitat availability were studied in 2003-2006 at fish-pond complexes located in the Lublin and Podlasie regions (eastern Poland). The structure of emergent vegetation and water depth were measured and described in 230 control squares and 98 squares with occupied nests. Water depth	 vegetation cover	 the height and diameter of reed shoots	 the number of flowering shoots	 the density of old (dry) and new (green) reed shoots were measured. Great bittern females nested in all available types of emergent vegetation and most of the nests were located in reedbeds. Using the logistic regression model it was shown that when choosing the place for nesting the great bitterns preferred reedbeds with a high density of old-reed stems.												
AB There has been a considerable amount of research in recent years regarding energy conservation in supply chains. However	 warehouses	 which are important nodes in most supply chains	 have been largely overlooked	 particularly with regard to the large existing stock of current warehouses. This paper adopts the energy audit approach that is used in other building types and develops this for use in existing warehouses. This is then applied to a single case study with multiple embedded units of analysis	 namely four company-operated ambient warehouses. The results indicate that energy conservation opportunities (ECOs) vary considerably in terms of the reliability of the estimated energy saving	 the likely persistency of that saving and the capital investment required. The developed framework can be used in this context to identify significant ECOs and to prioritise these for management.										
AB We propose a class of estimators of the Bayes factor which is based on an extension of the bridge sampling identity of Meng & Wong (1996) and makes use of the output of the reversible jump algorithm of Green (1995). Within this class we give the optimal estimator and also a suboptimal one which may be simply computed on the basis of the acceptance probabilities used within the reversible jump algorithm for jumping between models. The proposed estimators are very easily computed and lead to a substantial gain of efficiency in estimating the Bayes factor over the standard estimator based on the reversible jump output. This is illustrated through a series of Monte Carlo simulations involving a linear and a logistic regression model.																
AB A nationally representative survey of students' learning behaviors observed by classroom teachers of 1	500 school-aged American youth is presented. Participants comprised the standardization cohort of the Learning Behaviors Scale (McDermott	 Green	 Francis	 & Stott	 1999) stratified according to the U.S. Census. Base rates of learning behaviors are analyzed for both rank-order precedence and overall prevalence across demographic categories of sex	 ethnicity	 age group	 parent education	 residence location	 household configuration	 and special education status. Correlations detected minimal variability in behavioral item rankings across demographic groups. In contrast	 multiple ordinal logistic regression demonstrated considerably increased odds of maladaptive learning behaviors among males and students in special education. Moderate differences were found for age	 ethnicity	 and low parent educational level	 whereas few differences were associated with location of residence or family constellation.	
AB This paper proposes a multi-objective possibilistic programming model to design a sustainable medical supply chain network under uncertainty considering conflicting economic	 environmental and social objectives. Effective social and environmental life cycle assessment-based methods are incorporated in the model to estimate the relevant environmental and social impacts. An accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm utilizing three efficient acceleration mechanisms is devised to cope with computational complexity of solving the proposed model. Computational analysis is also provided by using a medical industrial case study to present the significance of the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the accelerated Benders decomposition algorithm.

AB The paper examines the diffusion of lead-free soldering in ICT manufacturers in China as response to EU's RoHS directives	 in order to investigate the global-local networks linking the lead market with the producers in developing countries. The result shows rapid diffusion of the technological change triggered by such regulation among Chinese firms. The diffusion however occurs at varied rates in different regions	 depending on their export orientation. The logistic regression model shows that	 other than firm attributes	 such as the position in the product chains and the firm-level environmental performance	 two geographical factors	 i.e.	 target markets and local cluster effects	 are also significant in influencing firm's technological choices	 while capital sources is less important (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Thirty-four states had adopted Sustainable Energy Portfolio Standards (SEPS) or similar goals by the end of 2008	 with 14 adoptions since 2006. There appears to be something trendy about SEPS and states may adopt SEPS when internal variables would indicate otherwise. This analysis extends the current discussion of SEPS adoption beyond internal variables	 relying on innovation and diffusion theory. Logistic regression with SEPS adoption as the dependent variable is used to test internal determinants and diffusion measures for the years 1997-2008. Of the internal determinants variables	 affluence and government ideology were found to be positive and significant. The results show that regional and neighbor diffusion variables are significant in SEPS adoption decisions-even when accounting for ideological distance from previous adopters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The recent shift from buying products to purchasing sets of services makes the re-use of recovered materials	 parts and products desirable. In response to heightened governmental regulations and rising public awareness of the effect of industrial production on the environment	 many organizations are now undertaking major initiatives to transform their supply chain processes. In contrast with the reverse logistic models	 the green supply chain ( GSC) is a broad concept that refers to a variety of methods by which companies work with their suppliers to improve the environmental performance of their products or manufacturing processes of the suppliers	 customers or both. Two primary goals of GSC include: ( 1) consistently meeting specified environmental performance criteria among the participants in the supply chain	 and promoting responsible corporate environmental behaviour among all the players in the chain of products and services	 and ( 2) helping suppliers to recognize the importance of resolving environmental issues and support them in installing their own improvement initiatives. The emergence of GSC is one of the most significant environmental developments in the past decade	 offering the opportunity for companies to align their supply chains in accordance with environmental and sustainability goals. GSC provides information and technical assistance to small-and medium-sized businesses that lack the resources of large companies	 and can monitor and measure progress to facilitate environmental enhancement. The number of products produced entirely of recyclable materials will increase in the future	 and organizations will have to make supply chain decisions within the context of growing environmental concerns and responsibilities. This study presents an innovative method using simple and efficient procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of projects supplying GSC concept. Specifically	 a multi-objective decision making process for GSC management ( GSCM) is presented to help the supply chain manager in measuring and evaluating suppliers' performance based on an analytical hierarchy process ( AHP) decision-making method. In addition	 to reduce subjective bias in designing a weighting system	 a fuzzy logic process is used to modify the AHP.				
AB Vegetation phenology is closely connected to the terrestrial carbon budget	 and interacts with the atmosphere through surface water and energy exchange. A comprehensive and detailed characterization of the spatio-temporal pattern of vegetation phenology can be used to improve the understanding of interactions between vegetation and climate in Africa. This research provides an approach to derive phenology time and trajectory parameters by optimally fitting a double-logistic curve to daily remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager. The proposed algorithm can reconstruct the temporal LAI trajectory based on the optimized parameters with a high accuracy	 and provides user-defined phenological timing information (e.g.	 start/end of the growing season) and trajectory information (e.g.	 leaf emergence/senescence rate and length) using these fitted parameters. Both single and double growing-season cases have been considered with a spatial classification scheme implemented over Africa. The newly derived vegetation phenology of Africa exhibits emerging spatial patterns in growing season length	 asymmetric green-up and green-off length/rate	 and distinctive phenological features of cropland and natural vegetation. This approach has the potential to be applied globally	 and the derived vegetation phenological information will improve dynamic vegetation modeling and climate prediction.									
AB Based on recent research on erosion of ecosystem services	 planetary boundaries and predicted pace of urbanization	 it is now apparent that humans need to reconnect to the biosphere and that cities in this context	 properly managed	 could provide great opportunities and arenas for social ecological change and transformation towards sustainability To take advantage of these opportunities one needs to keep in mind that most of the ecosystem services consumed in cities are generated by ecosystems located outside of the cities themselves	 not seldom half a world away. In order to operationalize our knowledge	 hypothesis and theories on the connections between the work of nature and the welfare and survival of humans overtime	" we suggest the use of the ecosystem service framework in combination with the merging of the concept ""ecology in cities"""	 mainly focusing on designing energy efficient building	 sustainable logistics and providing inhabitants with healthy and functioning green urban environments	" and the ""ecology of dries"". The ""ecology of cities"" framework acknowledges the total dependence of cities on the surrounding landscape and the ever-ongoing dance between urban and rural"	 viewing the city as an ecosystem.

AB The colour morphs of immature female cones in European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) are green	 red	 and intermediate in colour. For the first time	 these three colour morphs were studied to verify the thermoregulatory hypothesis and to investigate its underlying genetic spatial pattern. The study was based on an extensive systematic sampling	 and data were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA)	 binary logistic regression (BLR)	 and spatial autocorrelation. Correlations between the nontransformed environmental variables and PC scores revealed two main ecological gradients	 (i) altitude-temperate and (ii) annual precipitation. Loadings of the first two principal components exceeded 85% in both species. BLR was used to test the effect of the altitude-temperature gradient on the probability of occurrence of a specific cone colour. In both species	 the occurrence of red cones was significantly positively related to high altitude with low temperatures	 while green cones were significantly negatively correlated with decreasing temperature and increasing altitude. In both species the spatial pattern based on a putative Mendelian gene was nonrandom as indicated by significantly high Moran's I values based on altitudinal distance. Spatial genetic structure was probably maintained by limited gene flow and balanced selection that maintained short-distance genetic differentiation.							
AB In recent years consumers and legislation have been pushing companies to design their activities in such a way as to reduce negative environmental impacts more and more. It is therefore important to examine the optimization of total supply chain costs and environmental impacts together. However	 because of the recycling of deteriorated items	 the environmental impacts of deteriorating items are more significant than those of non-deteriorating ones.														
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative hepatic insufficiency is a critical complication after extended hepatic resection in patients with biliary tract malignancies	 the majority of whom suffer from obstructive jaundice. The aim of this study was to assess clinical parameters linked to this type of liver dysfunction.															
AB The effects of four average temperatures (7	 16	 23 and 33 degrees C) and daily oscillations with three amplitudes (0	 +/- 4	 +/- 7 degrees C) on the survival of the enteropathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium were investigated in small microcosms. Manure was inoculated with a green fluorescent protein transformed strain of either pathogen at 10(7) cells g(-1) dry weight. Samples were collected immediately after inoculation	 and 1 and 2 weeks after inoculation for E. coli O157:H7	 and immediately and after 2 and 3 weeks for Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. Population densities were determined by dilution plating and direct counting. In addition	 total bacterial CFUs were determined. Growth and survival data were fitted to a modified logistic model. Analysis of the estimated parameter values showed that E. coli O157:H7 survived for shorter periods of time and was more sensitive to competition by the native microbial community than Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. Survival of both pathogens significantly declined with increasing mean temperatures and with increasing amplitude in daily temperature oscillations. The results indicated that responses of enteropathogens to fluctuating temperatures cannot be deduced from temperature relationships determined under constant temperatures.									
AB The purpose of this research was to determine changes in negative air ion (NAI) concentrations produced by plants grown under different light intensities. NAI concentrations were observed and analyzed in an outdoor green space with five plant species (Aloe arborescens	 Clivia miniata	 Chlorophytum comosum	 Opuntia brunnescens	 Crassula portulacea) and A. arborescens was then grown under controlled-light conditions in an enclosed space for the subsequent light intensity experiment.												
AB An indefinite weight eigenvalue problem characterizing the threshold condition for extinction of a population based on the single-species diffusive logistic model in a spatially heterogeneous environment is analyzed in a bounded two-dimensional domain with no-flux boundary conditions. In this eigenvalue problem	 the spatial heterogeneity of the environment is reflected in the growth rate function	 which is assumed to be concentrated in n small circular disks	 or portions of small circular disks	 that are contained inside the domain. The constant bulk or background growth rate is assumed to be spatially uniform. The disks	 or patches	 represent either strongly favorable or strongly unfavorable local habitats. For this class of piecewise constant bang-bang growth rate function	 an asymptotic expansion for the persistence threshold lambda(1)	 representing the positive principal eigenvalue for this indefinite weight eigenvalue problem	 is calculated in the limit of small patch radii by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. By analytically optimizing the coefficient of the leading-order term in the asymptotic expansion of lambda(1)	 general qualitative principles regarding the effect of habitat fragmentation are derived. In certain degenerate situations	 it is shown that the optimum spatial arrangement of the favorable habit is determined by a higher-order coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of the persistence threshold.					
AB Objective: To study unhealthy dietary behaviors amongst adolescent students in South Delhi and the epidemiological correlates. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Three schools and two colleges in South Delhi. Subjects: Adolescent students aged 14-19 year selected by multi-stage cluster sampling. Statistical Analysis: Proportions	 Chi square test	 Multivariate logistic regression. Results: Almost half of the respondents reported not having fruits	 green vegetables or other vegetables daily. About 177 (32.2%) students were having 'junk food' and 28.2% were consuming carbonated soft drinks daily. More boys than girls reported unhealthy dietary practices. One in every two students (49.6%) had missed their breakfast once or more in the past 30 days. On logistic regression analysis	 father's education and type of residence were found to be the two chief correlates of unhealthy dietary behaviors. Adolescents with father's education level lesser than graduation were more likely to be at risk for unhealthy dietary practices (Odds Ratio 4.5	 95% CI: 1.6-12.7). Those residing in private colonies or bungalows were more likely to be having unhealthy dietary practices	 than those from government colonies (OR 2.9	 95% CI: 1.3-6.5). Conclusion: The dietary behavior of an overwhelming majority of the students was found to be unhealthy. The study points to an urgent need for measures amongst the adolescents to prevent a catastrophic burden of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes in the coming generations.

AB As the management of returned products is fast becoming a business trend caused by pressure for compliance	 asset recovery is increasingly viewed as a fertile area for firms to reduce cost and improve quality. Environmental management is a viable approach for Chinese manufacturers to respond to the escalating international quest for conserving the environment	 to tackle the problem of rising raw material costs	 and to improve product quality by analyzing returned products. To reach the goals of cost reduction and product quality improvement	 manufacturers need to understand how asset recovery can be leveraged through procedure-based practices and stakeholder support to enhance performance. Product type	 characterized by different levels of demand uncertainty and time-to-market	 may affect the outcomes of asset recovery adoption and should also be taken into account. Drawing on the environmental management and business logistics literature	 we provide empirical insights on asset recovery adoption using survey data collected from export-oriented Chinese manufacturers. We find that asset recovery and stakeholder support are complementary in strengthening manufacturers' financial performance regardless of product type. In addition	 the performance impact of asset recovery can be substantial when manufacturers' environmental management practices are less procedural	 allowing flexibility in the logistics management of product flows.

AB Background and aims: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It may produce complications. The indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) has been used to predict complications after hepatectomy. In this study	 the prediction of the value of ICGR15 for complications of RFA to the patients with HCC was evaluated.															
AB Background: Correct control selection is crucial to the internal validity of case-control studies. Little information exists on differences between population and hospital controls in case-control studies on cancers in Chinese hospital setting.																
AB Context Despite the fact that herbal products (HP) are used frequently during gestation worldwide	 studies indicate that they may not be free of danger for fetuses. Evidence about the safety of HP use during pregnancy and their impact on pregnancy outcomes is currently lacking.															
AB The Asian citrus psyllid	 Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae)	 is the primary vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) associated with huanglongbing	 or citrus greening	 the most devastating citrus (Citrus spp.) disease worldwide. Here	" we developed a new ""excised-leaf assay"" that can speed up Las-inoculativity tests on Asian citrus psyllid from the current 3-12 mo (when using whole citrus seedlings for inoculation) to only 2-3 wk. Young adults of Asian citrus psyllid that had been reared on Las-infected plants were caged on excised healthy sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] leaves for a 1-2-wk inoculation access periods (IAP)"	 and then both psyllids and leaves were tested later by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When single adults were tested per leaf	 percentages of Las-positive leaves averaged 2-6% by using HLBaspr primers and 10-20% by using the more sensitive LJ900 primers. Higher proportions of Las-positive leaves were obtained with 1) higher densities of inoculating psyllids (5-10 adults per leaf)	 2) longer IAPs	 and 3) incubation of leaves for 1 wk postinoculation before PCR. Logistic regression analysis indicated a positive correlation between Las titer in Asian citrus psyllid adults tested singly and the probability of detecting Las in the inoculated leaves	 correlations that can be very useful in epidemiological studies. Comparison between excised leaves and whole seedlings	 inoculated consecutively for 1 wk each by one or a group of psyllids	 indicated no significant difference between Las detection in excised leaves or whole plants. This new excised-leaf assay method saves considerable time	 materials	 and greenhouse space	 and it may enhance vector relation and epidemiological studies on Las and potentially other Liberibacter spp. associated with huanglongbing disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Green spaces have been associated with both health benefits and risks in children; however	 available evidence simultaneously investigating these conflicting influences	 especially in association with different types of greenness	 is scarce.													
AB Background: Risk factors for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) differ among populations and remain controversial. We carried out a hospital-based case-control study to examine the effects of health status	 lifestyle	 and some genetic polymorphisms on ccRCC risk in Chinese subjects. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009	 250 newly diagnosed	 histologically confirmed ccRCC cases and 299 sex-	 age-matched healthy controls provided complete information including consumption of tea and alcohol	 smoking	 occupational exposure	 body mass index (BMI)	 hypertension	 diabetes	 and urolithiasis by face-to-face interview in Shanghai. Genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (CYP1A1: 6235T>C	 4889A>G	 and 4887C>A)	 glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1: 342A>G)	 and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2: 481C>T	 590G>A
AB The present study investigated the effect of two natural antioxidants	 i.e. antioxidant of bamboo leaves (AOB) and extract of green tea (EGT)	 on the mitigation and the kinetic behavior of acrylamide in an equimolar asparagine-glucose model system (pH 6.80). The substrates with addition of AOB or EGT were oven-heated at 180 degrees C under low-moisture conditions and the acrylamide content in final reaction products was quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Results of mitigation effect on the generation of acrylamide showed that both AOB and EGT could effectively reduce the formation of acrylamide and achieve a maximum reduction rate (74.4% for the use of AOB and 74.3% for the use of EGT) when the addition levels of AOB and EGT were both 10(-4) mg. Such mitigation effect in the model system was further confirmed by addition of homoorientin. and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)	 the representative components in AOB and EGT. To describe the kinetic behavior of acrylamide	 a logistic-exponential model was selected among three kinetic model candidates while relative kinetic rate constants were calculated by the Marquardt non-linear regression method. Results indicated that there were significant differences on kinetic parameters (k(g) and t(cg)) between AOB/EGT-spiked and non-spiked model system studies	 which suggested that addition of AOB or EGT could reduce the formation of acrylamide during the formation-predominant kinetic stage and prolong the formation progress of acrylamide in the low-moisture reaction system. However	 such addition method was not able to reduce the acrylamide content during the elimination-predominant kinetic stage of acrylamide. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the use and users of urban green spaces (UGSs) is necessary for effective planning	 management	 and design. However	 most studies focus on developed cities; only a few focus on developing cities. This research aims to investigate the visit patterns of UGSs and the related sociodemographic associations in Guangzhou	 China. A face-to-face survey was conducted in 24 UGSs by stratified random sampling. A total of 595 valid questionnaires were obtained and analyzed. Descriptive statistics presented the visit patterns of UGSs	 and multivariate logistic regression revealed the sociodemographic associations. Results indicated that walking dominated the multiple-activity pattern in UGSs	 with more than 80% of the respondents visiting UGSs at least once a week or more. Residential green spaces and parks were the most visited areas	 whereas greenbelts and small gardens were less favored. Walking was the common mode of travel	 with very few individuals driving and cycling. Friends and family were the major visit companions	 and one-third of the respondents visited UGSs alone. The visit patterns significantly varied with socio-demographic variables	 particularly the activity patterns in UGSs and visit companions. For example	 20 min walking distance is a critical divide in determining whether the respondents walked to UGSs. Socio-demographic variations must be considered in the decision-making process of UGSs	 and this condition justifies the adoption of a participatory approach. The findings can help managers operate UGSs effectively and target improvement strategies strategically and thus provide important implications for other developing cities. Future studies should consider non-users and UGS use (activity patterns) of the older population and further examine the associations of activity patterns and visit frequency with place of residence using consistent methodologies.

AB Wooded habitats represent hotspots of urban biodiversity	 however	 urban development imposes pressure on biota in these refuges. Identification of the most influential habitat attributes and the role of local urban characteristics is crucial for proper decisions on management practices supporting biodiversity. We aimed to identify well manageable fine-scale habitat attributes to suggest specific	 feasible and affordable management recommendations for green space in cities. We analysed species richness of woodland-associated bird communities and incidence of individual species at 290 sites in a wide variety of green areas scattered across the city of Prague	 Czech Republic. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and regression tree analyses were used to identify site-scale (100 m radius sampling sites) and local-scale (200 m and 500 m radius plots) habitat attributes shaping the bird communities at individual sites. Logistic regression was used to assess the responses of individual species to habitat characteristics. Our results imply that at the site scale	 management practices should focus on maintenance and promoting species-diverse and older tree stands	 with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees. Water-bodies and accompanying riparian habitats should be maintained and carefully managed to preserve high-quality remnants of natural vegetation. Presence of a few old trees (about 12 % of tree cover with DBH > 50 cm) or small urban standing water and watercourses enrich the bird community by at least two species. Species richness of woodland avifauna at particular sites is further supported by the total amount of tree cover in the surroundings	 including scattered greenery of public spaces and private gardens. We conclude that proper management at site scale has the potential to increase biodiversity of the urban environment.									
AB Performance validity tests (PVTs) such as Green's Word Memory Test (WMT) are designed to have face validity as memory tests while individuals with neurologically based memory deficits can score adequately provided there is sufficient task engagement. Some patients with severe memory loss have performed poorly on the WMT	 raising questions about false positive errors. This study compared performances of 43 patients with left	 right	 or bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy on the WMT to a test known to be sensitive to temporal lobe pathology	 the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The right TLE group outperformed the left on the WMT free recall (FR) scores and RAVLT short-delay and long-delay trials (Trials 6 and 7) (p < .05); no other between-group differences occurred (p .10). Ten participants (20.4%) performed below the cut-off score on at least one WMT effort subtest	 but eight (80%) exhibited the genuine memory impairment profile (GMIP). Logistic regression found no WMT subtest contributed to predicting side of seizure with RAVLT scores in the model. Data suggest WMT primary effort subtests are generally insensitive to known temporal lobe pathology	 and using the GMIP is valuable to identify individuals with severe memory loss who score below criterion on WMT primary effort subtests.										
AB In the present study	 Cd2+ adsorption on polyacrylate-coated TiO2 engineered nanoparticles (TiO2-ENs) and its effect on the bioavailability as well as toxicity of Cd2+ to a green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were investigated. TiO2-ENs could be well dispersed in the experimental medium and their pH(pzc) is approximately 2. There was a quick adsorption of Cd2+ on TiO2-ENs and a steady state was reached within 30 min. A pseudo-first order kinetics was found for the time-related changes in the amount of Cd2+ complexed with TiO2-ENs. At equilibrium	 Cd2+ adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm with the maximum binding capacity 31.9	 177.1	 and 242.2 mg/g when the TiO2-EN concentration was 1	 10	 and 100 mg/l	 respectively. On the other hand	 Cd2+ toxicity was alleviated in the presence of TiO2-ENs. Algal growth was less suppressed in treatments with comparable total Cd2+ concentration but more TiO2-ENs. However	 such toxicity difference disappeared and all the data points could be fitted to a single Logistic dose-response curve when cell growth inhibition was plotted against the free Cd2+ concentration. No detectable amount of TiO2-ENs was found to be associated with the algal cells. Therefore	 TiO2-ENs could reduce the free Cd2+ concentration in the toxicity media	 which further lowered its bioavailability and toxicity to C. reinhardtii.					
AB Objective: To ascertain the relationship between tea drinking and the risk of ovarian cancer among southern Chinese women	 a case-control study was conducted in southern China during 2006-2008. Methods: Five hundred incident patients with histologically confirmed epithelial carcinoma of the ovary and 500 controls (mean age 59 years) were recruited from four public hospitals in Guangzhou. Information on frequency	 quantity and duration of tea drinking	 amount of dried tea leaves brewed	 together with habitual diet and lifestyle characteristics	 was obtained face-to-face from participants using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between tea consumption variables and the ovarian cancer risk. Results: The control subjects reported higher tea consumption levels and prevalence (78.8%) than the ovarian cancer patients (51.4%). Regular drinking of green tea	 black tea and/or oolong tea was associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer	 the adjusted odds ratio being 0.29 (95% confidence interval 0.22-0.39) after accounting for confounding factors. When compared with non-drinkers	 apparent inverse dose-response relationships were observed for years of drinking	 number of cups and quantity of tea consumed	 as well as amount of dried tea leaves brewed (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Regular tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer for southern Chinese women. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The majority of CRC arise in adenomatous polyps and 25-35% of colon adenoma risk could be avoidable by modifying diet and lifestyle habits. We assessed the association between diet and the risk of self-reported physician-diagnosed colorectal polyps among 2	818 subjects who had undergone colonoscopy. Subjects participated in 2 cohort studies: the AHS-1 in 1976 and the AHS-2 from 2002-2005. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the period risk of incident cases of polyps; 441 cases of colorectal polyps were identified. Multivariate analysis adjusted by age	 sex	 body mass index	 and education showed a protective association with higher frequency of consumption of cooked green vegetables (OR 1 time/d vs. 5/wk = 0.76	 95% CI= 0.59-0.97) and dried fruit (OR 3+ times/wk vs. 1 time/wk= 0.76	 95%CI = 0.58-0.99). Consumption of legumes at least 3 times/wk reduced the risk by 33% after adjusting for meat intake. Consumption of brown rice at least 1 time/wk reduced the risk by 40%. These associations showed a dose-response effect. High frequency of consumption of cooked green vegetables	 dried fruit	 legumes	 and brown rice was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal polyps.							
AB Many phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables have been shown to have cancer-inhibitory effects in animal studies. These effects on cancer	 however	 have not been clearly demonstrated in human studies. This study investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intakes and the risk of adenomatous polyps. Participants were part of the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. Eligible participants aged 40-75 y were recruited from patients undergoing colonoscopy at 2 medical centers in Nashville	 Tennessee from 2003 to 2005. Cases had at least one adenoma and controls were polyp free. Dietary intake was assessed using a self-administered FFQ. Associations between dietary intakes and adenoma risk were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression with restricted cubic function spline. In multivariate analyses of 764 cases and 1517 controls	 increased intakes of total fruits	 berries	 fruit juice	 and green leafy vegetables were associated with reduced adenoma risk. The odds ratio for upper tertile intake compared with lower was 0.66 (95% Cl = 0.51-0.86) for total fruits	 0.64 (95% Cl = 0.47-0.87) for berries	 0.72 (95% Cl = 0.56-0.92) for fruit juice	 and 0.74 (95% Cl = 0.58-0.96) for green vegetables. This study provides additional evidence that high total fruit intake and certain fruit and vegetable intakes maybe associated with a reduced risk of colorectal adenomas. J. Nutr. 139: 340-344	 2009.					
AB A color image encryption scheme using gyrator transform and Arnold transform is proposed	 which has two security levels. In the first level	 the color image is separated into three components: red	 green and blue	 which are normalized and scrambled using the Arnold transform. The green component is combined with the first random phase mask and transformed to an interim using the gyrator transform. The first random phase mask is generated with the sum of the blue component and a logistic map. Similarly	 the red component is combined with the second random phase mask and transformed to three-channel-related data. The second random phase mask is generated with the sum of the phase of the interim and an asymmetrical tent map. In the second level	 the three-channel-related data are scrambled again and combined with the third random phase mask generated with the sum of the previous chaotic maps	 and then encrypted into a gray scale ciphertext. The encryption result has stationary white noise distribution and camouflage property to some extent. In the process of encryption and decryption	 the rotation angle of gyrator transform	 the iterative numbers of Arnold transform	 the parameters of the chaotic map and generated accompanied phase function serve as encryption keys	 and hence enhance the security of the system. Simulation results and security analysis are presented to confirm the security	 validity and feasibility of the proposed scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Field experiments were conducted in Nebraska with the experimental herbicide KIH-485 on soils with three different levels of organic matter (OM) to ascertain a dose response for weed control and corn tolerance. Dose-response curves based on the log-logistic model were used to determine the effective dose that provides 90% weed control (ED(90) values) for three grasses (green foxtail	 field sandbur	 large crabgrass) and two broadleaf weeds (velvetleaf	 tall waterhemp). The ED90 values for green foxtail control were 143	 165	 and 202 g ai/ha for soils with 1	 2	 and 3% OM	 respectively at 28 d after treatment (DAT). The highest dose of 371 g ai/ha was needed for field sandbur control at 28 DAT	 compared with 141 g ai/ha for large crabgrass	 152 g ai/ha for tall waterhemp	 and 199 g ai/ha for velvetleaf. There was no significant corn injury observed. Grain yield increased with increasing doses of KIH-485; optimum yield was achieved at about 195 g ai/ha. From the dose-response curves it is clear that the proposed label rate of KIH-485 of 200 to 300 g ai/ha will provide excellent control of most grasses and certain broadleaf weeds in corn for at least the first 4 wk of the growing season on soils up to 3% OM in the state of Nebraska.					
AB Rework is one of the main issues in reverse logistic and green supply chain	 since it can reduce production cost and environmental problem. Many researchers focus on developing rework model	 but few of them developed model for deteriorating items. In this paper	 we develop an economic production quantity (EPQ) model for deteriorating items with rework. In one cycle	 production facility can produce items in m production setups and one rework setup	 (m	 1) policy. An example and sensitivity analysis is shown to illustrate the model. The results show that the deteriorating rate affects the optimal cost per unit time	 but the effect is not significant. The parameters that significantly affect the optimal total cost per unit time are the serviceable holding cost	 the production setup cost and the demand rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Green [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87	 2662-2674 (1990)] suggested an efficient	 maximum-likelihood-based approach for adaptively estimating thresholds. Such procedures determine the signal strength on each trial by first identifying the most likely psychometric functions among the pre-proposed alternatives based on responses from previous trials	" and then finding the signal strength at the ""sweet point"" on that most likely function. The sweet point is the point on the psychometric function that is associated with the minimum expected variance. Here"	 that procedure is extended to reduce poor estimates that result from lapses in attention. The sweet points for the threshold	 slope	 and lapse parameters of a transformed logistic psychometric function are derived. In addition	 alternative stimulus placement algorithms are considered. The result is a relatively fast and robust estimation of a three-parameter psychometric function. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4733540]									
AB Empirical assessments of the impacts of Fairtrade certification environmental standards are lacking. This paper examines the effects of Fairtrade certification on agricultural practices through the case of coffee in Rwanda	 comparing Fairtrade certified cooperative farmers with non-certified cooperative farmers and farmers who do not belong to a cooperative. Survey data from 175 smallholder coffee farmers in Rwanda are reported and analyzed using logistic regression. The results indicate the importance of cooperative farmer organizations in influencing agricultural practices via opportunities for training and access to inputs	 and suggest that Fairtrade certification may in fact provide additional opportunities above and beyond cooperative producer organization that influence farmer agricultural practices. However	 counter to expectations	 Fairtrade certification does not have a strong overall effect on agricultural practices. The effectiveness of Fairtrade at shifting agricultural practices appears to depend on the national regulatory context and the availability of alternative practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 1994 ground fire ignited in forests of Douglas-fir	 Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mirb.) Franco	 on Beaver Mountain	 Utah. The Douglas-fir beetle	 Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins	 attacked a range of moderately fire-injured host conifers in 1995. Logistic regression models run for 1995 data illustrated that 1 year after the fire event the Douglas-fir beetle selected and attacked large-diameter Douglas-fir with 60%-80% bole char	 60%-80% crown volume scorch	 and 50%-70% probability of mortality due to fire. In 1996 beetle preference shifted to smaller-diameter trees with lighter fire injury	 because most large	 fire-damaged conifers were colonized by beetles in 1995. Although beetle populations did not reach outbreak proportions outside the fire boundary	 host selection shifted to green trees in 1997 along the burn perimeter. Log linear analysis indicated that increased brood production was conditioned by increased diameter and moderate fire damage to the trees.						
AB - This article considers the problem of finding a route and schedule for a vehicle starting from a depot	 visiting a set of customers	 and returning to the depot	 in a time-dependent network where the objective is to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions. In this formulation	 the speeds of the vehicle as well as the routes chosen are decision variables subject to limits determined by the level of congestion on the roads at the time. Two methods are proposed to find the optimal strategy for a single route. One is a time-increment-based dynamic programming method	 and the other is a new heuristic approach. In addition	 a case study is carried out	 which compares the performances of these methods	 as well as the least polluting routes with the shortest time routes between two customer nodes.

AB Purpose: To determine the association of fluorescein angiography characteristics with visual acuity and visual loss during medical treatment in patients with Behcet uveitis. Methods: Ninety-three eyes from 69 Behcet patients with active panuveitis underwent fluorescein angiography	 and the characteristic findings by angiography were determined. The patients were followed with immunomodulatory treatment. Results: Diffuse vascular leakage (73.4%)	 diffuse macular leakage (66.0%)	 and disc leakage (52.7%) were the predominant angiographic findings on fluorescein angiography. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a macular window defect and disc neovascularization on fluorescein angiography were associated with poor visual acuity ( 20/200) (p .05). The presence of macular ischemia on fluorescein angiography was significantly associated with the risk of visual loss ( 20/200) at 48 months post-treatment (p .05). Conclusions: These results suggest that fluorescein angiography may be helpful for predicting visual prognosis for Behcet patients with panuveitis.													
AB Riverine aquatic biodiversity is rapidly being lost worldwide	 but preservation efforts are hampered	 in part because studies of these dynamic environments are limited by cost and logistics to small local surveys. Full understanding of stream ecosystems requires precise	 high-resolution mapping of entire stream networks and adjacent landforms. We use a narrow-beam	 water-penetrating	 green lidar system to continuously map 10 km of a mountain stream channel	 including its floodplain topography	 and wavelet analyses to investigate spatial patterns of channel morphology and salmon spawning. Results suggest the broadest fluvial domains are a legacy of approximately 15 000 years of post-glacial valley evolution and that local pool-riffle channel topography is controlled by contemporary hydraulics operating on this broad template. Salmon spawning patterns closely reflect these hierarchical physical domains	 demonstrating how geomorphic history can influence modem distributions of aquatic habitat and organisms. The new terrestrial-aquatic lidar could catalyze rapid advances in understanding	 managing	 and monitoring of valuable aquatic ecosystems through unprecedented and attendant analyses.						
AB A random-walk Metropolis sampler is geometrically ergodic if its equilibrium density is super-exponentially light and satisfies a curvature condition [Stochastic Process. Appl. 85 (2000) 341-361]. Many applications	 including Bayesian analysis with conjugate priors of logistic and Poisson regression and of log-linear models for categorical data result in posterior distributions that are not super-exponentially light. We show how to apply the change-of-variable formula for diffeomorphisms to obtain new densities that do satisfy the conditions for geometric ergodicity. Sampling the new variable and mapping the results back to the old gives a geometrically ergodic sampler for the original variable. This method of obtaining geometric ergodicity has very wide applicability.															
AB Despite the good HAART coverage of HIV infected patients in Chile	 treatment success is interfered by patient-adherence problems. Moreover	 REV and depression co-morbidity has been shown to impair self-care and medication adherence. With the aim to analyze adherence problems and its relationship with depression in HIV infected patients	 we evaluated 119 HIV infected patients	 attending Coquimbo's Hospital. Our sample was incidental and transversally evaluated with: Morisky	 Green & Levine Medication Adherence Scale	 and the Beck - II Depression Inventory. In addition	 demographic and health data were obtained from clinical files. Main results showed that 68% patients referred having HAART adherence problems	 with differences in sex	 age and treatment duration. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with moderate-severe depressive symptoms have 3	08 (95% IC 1	08-8	80) times higher risk of having adherence problems compared to patients with mild to no depressive symptoms.

AB Early surgical management of those burn injuries that will not heal spontaneously is critical. The decision to excise and graft is based on a visual assessment that is often inaccurate but yet continues to be the primary means of grading the injury. Superficial and intermediate partial-thickness injuries generally heal with appropriate wound care while deep partial-and full-thickness injuries generally require surgery. This study explores the possibility of using near-infrared spectroscopy to provide an objective and accurate means of distinguishing shallow injuries from deeper burns that require surgery. Twenty burn injuries are studied in five animals	 with burns covering < 1% of the total body surface area. Carefully controlled superficial	 intermediate	 and deep partial-thickness injuries as well as full-thickness injuries could be studied with this model. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used to evaluate these injuries 1 to 3 hours after the insult. A probabilistic model employing partial least-squares logistic regression was used to determine the degree of injury	 shallow (superficial or intermediate partial) from deep (deep partial and full thickness)	 based on the reflectance spectrum of the wound. A leave-animal-out cross-validation strategy was used to test the predictive ability of a 2-latent variable	 partial least-squares logistic regression model to distinguish deep burn injuries from shallow injuries. The model displayed reasonable ranking quality as summarized by the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve	 AUC=0.879. Fixing the threshold for the class boundaries at 0.5 probability	 the model sensitivity (true positive fraction) to separate deep from shallow burns was 0.90	 while model specificity (true negative fraction) was 0.83. Using an acute porcine model of thermal burn injuries	 the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy to distinguish between shallow healing burns and deeper burn injuries was demonstrated. While these results should be considered as preliminary and require clinical validation	 a probabilistic model capable of differentiating these classes of burns would be a significant aid to the burn specialist.

AB Identifying deep convection is of paramount importance	 as it may be associated with extreme weather phenomena that have significant impact on the environment	 property and populations. A new method	 the hail detection tool (HDT)	 is described for identifying hail-bearing storms using multispectral Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data. HDT was conceived as a two-phase method	 in which the first step is the convective mask (CM) algorithm devised for detection of deep convection	 and the second a hail mask algorithm (HM) for the identification of hail-bearing clouds among cumulonimbus systems detected by CM. Both CM and HM are based on logistic regression models trained with multispectral MSG data sets comprised of summer convective events in the middle Ebro Valley (Spain) between 2006 and 2010	 and detected by the RGB (red-green-blue) visualization technique (CM) or C-band weather radar system of the University of Leon. By means of the logistic regression approach	 the probability of identifying a cumulonimbus event with CM or a hail event with HM are computed by exploiting a proper selection of MSG wavelengths or their combination. A number of cloud physical properties (liquid water path	 optical thickness and effective cloud drop radius) were used to physically interpret results of statistical models from a meteorological perspective	" using a method based on these ""ingredients"". Finally"	 the HDT was applied to a new validation sample consisting of events during summer 2011. The overall probability of detection was 76.9% and the false alarm ratio 16.7 %.					
AB This special volume of the Journal of Cleaner Production was developed primarily based on materials presented at the 2nd International Workshop Advances in Cleaner Production held in Sao Paulo	 Brazil	 in 2009.

AB High blood pressure (HBP) is one of the most important risk factors for morbidity and mortality in the world. Non-adherence to medication is associated with the lack of control of HBP. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of four indirect methods for measuring adherence to medication to control HBP in primary health care. A random sample of 120 hypertensive patients who were undergoing treatment for at least 2 months in a primary care unit in Florianopolis ( Brazil) were included in the study. The independent variables were four indirect methods to measure adherence to medication: knowledge regarding the HBP medication	 the blood pressure level	 attitude regarding the medication intake (Morisky - Green test) and self-reported adherence. The classification of HBP was based on criteria established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The gold standard used for measuring adherence was the pill count. Logistic regression was used to estimate sensitivity ( highest value of 88.2% for self-report)	 specificity ( highest value of 70.7% for HBP control)	 positive predictive value ( highest value of 46.4% for HBP control) and negative predictive value ( highest value of 79.1% for Morisky - Green test) for each of the indirect methods. No indirect method of measuring adherence had a good positive predictive value for adherence	 which was best predicted by patients' age and whether they managed to control HBP. The results also revealed low treatment adherence (31.2%) and low control of HBP (37.6%). Non-adherence was mainly associated with side effects of the treatment.											
AB This study aimed to establish the effect of a diet enriched with green-lipped mussel (GLM) on pain and functional outcomes in osteoarthritic dogs. Twenty-three client-owned dogs with osteoarthritis (OA) were fed a balanced control diet for 30 d and then a GLM-enriched balanced diet for the next 60 d. We assessed peak vertical force (PVF)	 which is considered to be the gold standard method	 at Day (D) 0 (start)	 D30 (end of control diet)	 and D90 (end of GLM-enriched diet). The owners completed a client-specific outcome measure (CSOM)	 which is a pain questionnaire	 once a week. Motor activity (MA) was continuously recorded in 7 dogs for 12 wk. Concentrations of plasma omega-3 fatty acids were quantified as indicative of diet change. Statistical analyses were linear-mixed models and multinomial logistic regression for repeated measures. The GLM diet (from D30 to D90) resulted in an increase in concentrations of plasma omega-3 fatty acids (P < 0.016) and improvement of PVF (P = 0.003). From D0 to D30	 PVF did not significantly change (P = 0.06)	 which suggests that the GLM diet had a beneficial effect on gait function. Moreover	 PVF (P = 0.0004)	 CSOM (P = 0.006)	 and MA (P = 0.02) improved significantly from D0 to D90. In general	 the balanced control diet could have contributed to reduced OA symptoms	 an effect that was subsequently amplified by the GLM diet.

AB Researchers conducted a study in a Taiwanese medical center from June 2009 to June 2011 to investigate the relations of perceived stress and lifestyle to breast cancer. A total of 157 cases and 314 controls completed a structured questionnaire. Using multiple logistic regression models	 high perceived stress (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]	 1.102.47)	 less than 1	000 kcal of physical activity expenditure per week (AOR	 2.17; 95% CI	 1.393.39)	 and high intake of fried and stir-fried food (AOR	 1.86; 95% CI	 1.242.77) were positively associated with breast cancer. Breast cancer was related to joint interactions between high perceived stress and alcohol intake of 11.0 g or more per day (AOR	 2.91; 95% CI	 1.236.86)	 smoking at least one cigarette per day (AOR	 2.52; 95% CI	 1.165.47)	 intake of less than 100 ml of green tea per day (AOR	 2.47; 95% CI
AB Introduction: The endoscopic deployment and extraction of endoluminal stents	 such as ureteral stents	 is commonplace in contemporary medical management of many diseases. In a hemorrhagic environment	 endoscopic identification of a stent can be challenging. To date	 no study has evaluated the optimal color for endoscopic stent identification.												
AB Background: In rural. Xuanwei County	 China	 the high incidence of Lung cancer is attributable largely to burning smoky coal indoors for heating and cooking without adequate ventilation. Such burning generates very high levels of indoor air pollutants	 including carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	 which could contaminate foodstuffs in the home. Thus	 residents could be exposed to carcinogenic coat emissions not only via inhalation but also via ingestion of these foodstuffs. Methods: A population-based case-control. study of 498 Lung cancer patients and 498 controls was conducted from 1985 through 1990 in Xuanwei. The interviewer-administered study questionnaire queried the frequency of food items commonly consumed in this region. Overall and sex-specific multiple logistic regression models were constructed to estimate Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for consumption of these foods. Results: Intake of rice	 green vegetables	 mushrooms and fresh meat was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. In contrast	 intake of corn	 buckwheat	 radishes	 peppers	 melons	 pickled vegetables	 and salt-preserved meats was associated with reduced risk. The detrimental. effect of ingesting green vegetables (OR	 2.39; 95% CI	 1.28-4.48) is consistent with previous reports. Conclusions: These findings suggest that in Xuanwei
AB Background: Previous studies have demonstrated links between cardiovascular disease and physical inactivity and poor air quality	 which are both associated with neighborhood greenness. However	 no studies have directly investigated neighborhood greenness in relation to coronary heart disease risk. We investigated the effect of neighborhood greenness on both self-reported and hospital admissions of coronary heart disease or stroke	 accounting for ambient air quality	 socio-demographic	 behavioral and biological factors.											
AB Background: Positive emotional well-being is fundamentally important to general health status	 and is linked to many favorable health outcomes. There is societal interest in understanding determinants of emotional well-being in adolescence	 and the natural environment represents one potential determinant. Psychological and experimental research have each shown links between exposure to nature and both stress reduction and attention restoration. Some population studies have suggested positive effects of green space on various indicators of health. However	 there are limited large-scale epidemiological studies assessing this relationship	 specifically for populations of young people and in the Canadian context. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between exposure to public natural space and positive emotional well-being among young adolescent Canadians.												
AB Digital repeat photography has the potential to become an important long-term data source for phenological research given its advantages in terms of logistics	 continuity	 consistency and objectivity over traditional assessments of vegetation status by human observers. Red-green-blue (RGB) color channel information from digital images can be separately extracted as digital numbers	 and subsequently summarized through color indices such as excess green (ExG = 2G - [R + B]) or through nonlinear transforms to chromatic coordinates or other color spaces. Previous studies have demonstrated the use of ExG and the green chromatic coordinate (g(cc) = G/[R+ G + B]) from digital landscape image archives for tracking canopy development but several methodological questions remained unanswered. These include the effects of diurnal	 seasonal and weather-related changes in scene illumination on ExG and g(cc)	 and digital camera and image file format choice.											
AB Despite the large number of in situ	 plot-level phenological measurements and satellite-derived phenological studies	 there has been little success to date in merging these records temporally or spatially. In this research	 we bridge this scale gap through higher resolution satellite records (Landsat) and quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived metrics with direct field measurements. We compiled fifty-seven Landsat scenes from southern New England (P12 R51) from 1984 to 2002. Green vegetation areal abundance for each scene was derived from spectral mixture analysis and a single set of endmembers. The leaf area signal was fit with a logistic-growth simulating sigmoid curve to derive phenological markers (half-maximum leaf-onset and offset). Spring leaf-onset dates in homogenous stands of deciduous forests displayed significant and persistent local variability. The local variability was validated with multiple springtime ground observations (r(2)=0.91). The highest degree of verified small-scale variation occurred where contiguous forests displayed leaf-onset gradients of 10-14 days over short distances (< 500 m). These dramatic gradients occur in of low-relief (< 40 m) upland regions. The patterns suggest that microclimates resulting from springtime cold-air drainage may be influential in governing the start of leaf growth; every 4.16 m loss in elevation delayed spring leaf onset by 1 day. These microclimates may be of crucial importance in interpreting in situ records and interpolating phenology from satellite data. Regional patterns from the Landsat analyses suggest topographic	 coastal	 and land-use controls on phenology. Our results indicate that deciduous forests in the Providence	 RI metropolitan area leaf out 5-7 days earlier than comparable rural areas. The platform-independent curve-fit methodology may be extended across platforms and field data. The methodologically consistent approach	 in tandem with Landsat data	 allows an effective scaling from plot to satellite phenological observations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Blue-green algae (BGA) bloom is a typical phenomenon in eutrophied lakes. However	 up to now	 no environmental mechanism has been commonly accepted. Systematic and complete data sets of BGA blooms and environmental factors without any missing data are rare	 which seriously affected previous studies. In this study	 a bootstrapping based multiple imputation algorithm (EMB) was first applied to reconstruct a complete data set from the available data set with missing data	 hence forming a basis for quantitatively relating BGA bloom to contributing factors. Then	 the probability of RCA bloom outbreak was simulated using a binomial (or binary) logistic regression model	 which is an effective tool for recognizing key contributing factors. The results suggest that 1) the outbreak frequency or probability of BGA bloom tends to first increase and then decrease with a turning point between June and September each year: 2) air temperature	 relative humidity	 and precipitation were significant positive factors correlated with outbreak frequency	 whereas wind speed and the number of sunshine hours were negative factors: 3) water temperature had a strong positive effect on the probability of BGA bloom outbreak	 whereas other water quality factors	 such as concentrations of organics and nutrients	 were not so significant. However	 water quality factors	 such as NO3-N	 SD
AB Tree mortality in western conifer forests is a complex process involving several related factors. Conifer mortality tends to be more common in high-elevation forests where stress from weather	 insects	 and disease result in higher rates of mortality and in the drier interior forests where mortality from fire	 insects	 and disease are common. Immediate mortality from fire damage may be obvious	 but currently there is considerable controversy about labeling fire-injured green trees as dead that have a high probability of experiencing delayed mortality. Trees die when carbohydrates used in respiration exceed those produced in photosynthesis or water movement is impaired	 the tree desiccates	 and photosynthesis ceases. Immediate or delayed tree mortality may be directly due to biotic or abiotic causes and may be affected by previous damage	 current condition (vigor)	 and attack by secondary agents such as bark beetles. A particular pathogen or insect usually attacks	 damages	" or kills only one portion of a tree. Trees that are damaged or attacked by pests and expected to have a dead or nonfunctional root system or a nonfunctional stem within 5 years may be considered either dead or death is imminent. Numerous studies have produced logistic regression equations or other statistical models to help determine probability of tree survival. We define and propose that a ""dead tree"" designation is justified for most species when at least three of the four quadrants from around the base of the root collar has cambium"	 inner bark	 or phloem that are discolored and dead. For large ponderosa pines	 a dead tree has all four quadrants with dead cambium.		
AB Background: Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an optical enhancement technology that filters white light into two bandwidths of illumination centered on 415 nm (blue) and 540 nm (green). NBI cystoscopy can increase bladder cancer (BCa) visualization and detection at the time of transurethral resection (TUR). NBI may therefore reduce subsequent relapse following TUR.																
AB Distributions of pond-breeding amphibians may be influenced by habitat factors at different spatial scales. We used anuran calling surveys to investigate the association between 5 anuran species and habitat variables measured within 100	 500	 1000	 and 3000 m of sampling points at 63 coastal wetlands along the US shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Stepwise logistic regression was used to create predictive models for each species at each spatial scale. Our results confirm the view that habitat variables at multiple scales influence frog distributions	 but the strength of predictive models was significantly affected by the spatial scale at which habitat variables were derived. Remotely sensed habitat variables within a 3000 m radius were among the most effective predictors of occurrence for American toad (Bufo americanus)	 eastern gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor)	 spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer)	 and green frog (Rana clamitans melanota). The western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) was predicted most effectively by variables derived within a 500 m radius. For the most part	 these anurans exhibited species-specific responses to habitat variables; however the suite of landscape-scale variables associated with urban land use appeared in all species' regression models. Associations with landscape-scale variables coupled with well-documented habitat needs at local breeding sites suggest that conservation and assessment of frogs and toads in coastal wetlands should consider the influence of habitat variables at multiple spatial scales.								
AB Current models of vegetation dynamics using the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) time series perform poorly for high-latitude environments. This is due partly to specific attributes of these environments	 such as short growing season	 long periods of darkness in winter	 persistence of snow cover	 and dominance of evergreen species	 but also to the design of the models. We present a new method for monitoring vegetation activity at high latitudes	 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. It estimates the NDVI of the vegetation during winter and applies a double logistic function	 which is uniquely defined by six parameters that describe the yearly NDVI time series. Using NDVI data from 2000 to 2004	 we illustrate the performance of this method for an area in northern Scandinavia (35 x 162 km(2)	 68 degrees N 23 degrees E) and compare it to existing methods based on Fourier series and asymmetric Gaussian functions. The double logistic functions describe the NDVI data better than both the Fourier series and the asymmetric Gaussian functions	 as quantified by the root mean square errors. Compared with the method based on Fourier series	 the new method does not overestimate the duration of the growing season. In addition	 it handles outliers effectively and estimates parameters that are related to phenological events	 such as the timing of spring and autumn. This makes the method most suitable for both estimating biophysical parameters and monitoring vegetation phenology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.			
AB Background. One aspect of the cancer stem cell hypothesis is that patients with tumors that exhibit stem-like phenotypes have poor prognoses. Distal epithelial progenitors from lungs early in development demonstrate both self-renewal and potential to differentiate into all bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell types. By contrast	 late progenitors are only able to produce alveolar cells. We sought to create a lung-specific progenitor cell signature for possible prognosis prediction in human lung cancer.															
AB Background: Although extrahepatic metastasis occurs rarely after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)	 the prognosis of these patients is extremely poor. Predictors of extrahepatic metastasis have not been fully investigated.															
AB Although interest in addressing environmental perspectives in supplier management is rising	 incorporating the issue of carbon management into supplier selection in green supply chain is still considerably scarce. This study presents a model for evaluating carbon performance of suppliers by utilizing multiple-criteria decision-making. Through literature reviews and expert opinions	 13 criteria within carbon performance are identified for evaluating suppliers. Subsequently	 the analytic network process is utilized to determine the relative weights of each criterion. Finally	 the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje technique is employed to evaluate carbon performance of suppliers and compromise solution under each of the evaluation criteria. An illustrative example in an electronics company is presented to demonstrate how to select the most appropriate supplier in accordance with carbon management. To be effective in mitigating carbon risk across the supply chain	 the proposed hybrid model can help firms evaluate carbon performance of suppliers for facilitating low carbon supply chain.											
AB The present study investigated the feasibility of bioCO(2) sequestration using Chlorella sorokiniana. It was found that 5% CO2 (v/v) in air was the most suitable concentration for the growth of this organism. At this concentration	 the maximum rate of CO2 sequestered and the biomass obtained were found to be 1.21 g L-1 d(-1) and 4.4 g L-1 respectively. Modeling and simulation of the growth profile was obtained using the logistic equation. Further	 at higher CO2 concentrations	 pH drop in the growth media	 TAP [-acetate]	 was prevented by replacing NH4Cl by NaNO3. Additionally	 the study evaluated the performance of two reactors namely: bubble column and airlift reactor based on their growth profile and transport properties like K(L)a and mixing time. The growth profile was better in airlift reactor and it provides cyclic axial mixing of media. K(L)a of downcomer was significantly lower than the riser in airlift reactor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays	 the worldwide production of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) is consequently increasing	 reducing both resources and landfills. In this manuscript	 we investigate the significance of the factors that comprise the environmental sustainability strategies (environmental legislation and green image) and the operational features of the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) (chain's features	 products' features and economic parameters)	 their interactions and the type of their impact on the environmental (availability of natural resources and landfill availability) and economical sustainability of a WEEE CLSC. We use an extension of a System Dynamics-based model of a CLSC with recycling activities introduced by Georgiadis and Besiou [J Clean Prod 16(15):1665-1678	 2008]. The developed model is validated using data from a real-world CLSC of EEE in Greece. Extended numerical investigation provides insights to the managers of the WEEE CLSC and the legislators with regard to the actions which can lead to sustainability.										
AB Recent marine environment regulatory actions have ignited strong debates and discussions among policy-makers	 researchers and operators. This paper provides a methodological framework for the estimation of the cost impact of some of the environmental measurements	 and specifically on the increase of operating expenses of seagoing vessels due to the sulfur limits determined by MARPOL Annex VI. A model based on stochastic linear programming is presented that aims to minimize the total cost of an operator	 by determining the fleet-mix and the capacity offered under budgetary and fleet attributes constraints	 and taking into account demand and growth pattern per period of analysis. The stochastic scenarios are based on the probability of the fleet operating in a Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). A liner and a tramp shipping applications are presented	 and the results are discussed. The paper concludes with a summary of the achieved goals	 of the limitations of this model	 and the future development of this approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									
AB A hydrogen peroxide-based decontaminant	 Decon Green	 is efficacious for the decontamination of chemical agents VX (S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl O-ethyl methylphosphonothioate)	 GD (Soman	 pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate)	 and HD (mustard	 bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide); the biological agent anthrax (Bacillus anthracis); and radiological isotopes (137)Cs and (60)Co; thus demonstrating the ability of this decontamination approach to ameliorate the aftermath of all three types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Reaction mechanisms afforded for the chemical agents are discussed as are rationales for the enhanced removal efficacy of recalcitrant (60)Co on certain surfaces. Decontaminants of this nature can be deployed	 and are effective	 at very low temperatures (-32 degrees C)	 as shown for studies done with VX and HD simulants	 without the need for external heat sources. Finally	 the efficacy of a lower-logistics	 dry decontaminant powder concentrate (utilizing the solid active-oxygen compounds peracetyl borate and Peroxydone) which can be reconstituted with water in the field prior to use	 is presented.

AB Purpose: This study tested the hypothesis that volunteering in environmental organizations in midlife is associated with greater physical activity and improved mental and physical health over a 20-year period. Design and Methods: The study used data from two waves (1974 and 1994) of the Alameda County Study	 a longitudinal study of health and mortality that has followed a cohort of 6	928 adults since 1965. Using logistic and multiple regression models	 we examined the prospective association between environmental and other volunteerism and three outcomes (physical activity	 self-reported health	 and depression)	 with 1974 volunteerism predicting 1994 outcomes	 controlling for a number of relevant covariates. Results: Midlife environmental volunteering was significantly associated with physical activity	 self-reported health	 and depressive symptoms. Implications: This population-based study offers the first epidemiological evidence for a significant positive relationship between environmental volunteering and health and well-being outcomes. Further research	 including intervention studies	 is needed to confirm and shed additional light on these initial findings.					
AB To suppress weeds in an apple (Malus sp.) orchard	 we placed spruce (Picea spp.) bark mulch and cocoa (Theobroma cacao) husk mulch for 3months in thicknesses of 0	 2.5	 5	 10 and 15cm. To assess the development of weed cover	 an innovative use of log-logistic doseresponse models was applied	 with mulch thickness as the independent variable. Weed cover was measured by non-destructive image analysis by estimating the relationship between the number of green pixels and the total number of pixels in each experimental plot. The thickness of mulch layer required to attain a 50 and 90% weed suppression (ED50 and ED90) differed significantly within and between mulch types. In all except one instance	 the cocoa mulch was superior in suppressing weeds. This method was useful for the evaluation	 but further research is needed to give a more general conclusion about the suppression ability of the two mulches under other climatic and growing conditions.								
AB We examined two practical methods for reducing moisture content and/or ash content in biomass from southern pine harvests. Logging residues are a potential bioenergy feedstock	 but contaminants can increase ash content during collection. We found that trommel screens can reduce ash levels in grindings from southern pine roundwood and clean chipped logging residues from 4.0 to 1.4 % and 11.9 to 6 %	 respectively. Green whole-tree chips are a widely used form of forest biomass	 but are 50 % moisture. Felling and transpirationally drying in-field before chipping reduced moisture from 53 to 43 % and 39 % in 4 and 8 weeks	 respectively	 without changing ash content (< 0.7 %). Finally	 we used data from the screening and drying studies in a simulation study to estimate delivered costs for whole-tree chipping and screened and unscreened grinders processing logging and clean chip residue. Whole-tree chipping provided the lowest cost option at ash content levels less than 1 %	 and unscreened grinding of clean chip residue produced the least expensive option at 5 % ash.									
AB This paper addresses the optimal design and location facility of biodiesel supply chains (BSC) under economic and environmental criteria. The economical aspect scale is assessed by the total annualized cost. The environmental objective is evaluated by the total GHG (Green House Gases) emissions for a whole life cycle. A mathematical model that can be used to design the supply chain (SC) and manage the logistics of a biodiesel is proposed. The model determines the number	 size and location of biorefineries needed to produce biodiesel using the available biomass. Mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed that takes into account infrastructure compatibility	 demand distribution	 as male as the size and location of biorefineries needed to produce biodiesel using the available biomass and carbon tax. An important feature of the model proposed is the account requirement of crop rotation important from agronomic perspective. In second part of this study Bulgaria is examined as the testing ground of the model.													
AB Economical and environmental issues are the main driving forces for the development of closed-loop supply chains. This paper examines the impact of environmental issues on long-term behaviour of a single product supply chain with product recovery. The environmental issues examined are the firm's 'green image' effect on customer demand	 the take back obligation imposed by legislation	 and the state campaigns for proper disposal of used products. The behaviour of the system is analyzed through a dynamic. simulation model based on the principles of the system dynamics (SD) methodology. This model includes all major inventories of new	 used and recovered products and the flows among them. Inventory levels and flow rates are linked through differential equations. The dynamic model provides an experimental simulation tool	 which can be used to evaluate the effect of environmental issues on long-term decision making in collection and remanufacturing activities and on product demand. Numerical analysis illustrates the potential uses of the methodology. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.												
AB Advance warning signals are installed upstream of high-speed signalized intersections to warn motorists of impending signal changes. A new advance warning signal design was tested on an approach to a high-speed signalized intersection in Utah that utilized a dynamic blank-out sign with flashers mounted over the roadway. A state-of-the-art evaluation system was installed to collect continuous	 nonintrusive data of vehicle speeds and red-light running events. Data were collected prior to and immediately after installation. Cumulative distributions of speed profile data showed statistically significant results after blank-out overhead dynamic advance warning signal (BODAWS) installation evidenced by an increase in mean speeds of 5 - 10 mph during the green interval	 while the system was inactive	 followed by a decrease in mean speeds of 5 - 10 mph after activation of the system. The system also reduced red-light running at the site during the time period immediately after BODAWS installation from five violations per million entering vehicles to one violation per million entering vehicles in the northbound direction	 a statistically significant change using logistic regression.												
AB The paper designs a color image encryption scheme based on skew tent map and hyper chaotic system of 6th-order CNN. The essence of the image encryption is to confuse and diffuse the pixels	 the skew tent map is applied to generate the confusion sequence	 and the hyper chaotic system of 6th-order CNN is applied to generate the diffusion sequence	 for 6 state variables in the system	 there are total 120 combinations. For each pixel of the plain image	 one combination is chosen to encryption the red	 green and blue components	 and the combination is determined by one of the state variables. Each pixel is encrypted by the cipher value of the previous pixel and the combination value of the CNN system. Experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that the scheme can achieve good encryption result and larger key space	 and can resist common attacks	 so the scheme can be applied in secure communication to enhance the security of transmitting image.

AB The significance of Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV) for the overwintering capacity of honeybee colonies was studied under field conditions. A case-control study of samples collected in Germany from 2004 to 2006 was performed. Successfully wintering colonies (control) were compared with winter fatalities (cases)	 using a binary logistic regression model that focused on the pre-winter ABPV burden as the explanatory variable. To quantify the ABPV burden a SYBR Green (R) based real time PCR protocol was developed. An ABPV-specific primer pair hybridising to the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase region was used. The assay proved to be ABPV specific and reproducible. ABPV infection was more often observed in colonies that did not survive the winter. In addition	 winter fatalities showed higher ABPV burden than surviving colonies. Our findings provide support for a strong and presumably causal relationship between winter mortality	 Varroa destructor and ABPV.													
AB Working in small businesses has been identified as a key factor for low coverage rates in immigrant communities. In this study	 we identify specific cultural and socioeconomic predictors of Asian Americans who work in small businesses to identify subgroups at a greater disadvantage than others in obtaining health insurance. Logistic regression models were fitted using a sample of 3	819 Asian American small business owners and employers extracted from pooled 2005-2012 California Health Interview Survey data. We found that individuals with low income levels	 Korean Americans	 U.S.-born South Asian and Southeast Asian (other than Vietnamese) Americans	 immigrants without citizenship (particularly those lacking a green card)	 and individuals with limited English proficiency had higher odds of lacking coverage. The odds of being uninsured did not differ between small business owners and employees. Based upon these key findings	 we propose several strategies to expand coverage for Asian Americans working in small businesses and their most vulnerable subgroups.									
AB As corporations attempt to move toward environmental sustainability	 management must extend their efforts to improve environmental practices across their supply chain. To date	 the literature characterising environmental management within the supply chain has been slowly building	 but remains sparse. Moreover	 investment by plants in environmental technologies cannot be made independently of other organisations in the supply chain. The linkage between supply chain characteristics	 such as the degree of integration with primary suppliers and major customers	 and the resources invested in different environmental technologies is assessed with plant-level survey data. The results indicate that resources were increasingly allocated toward pollution prevention when plants developed extensive strategic-level integration with suppliers	 including such aspects as product development and knowledge sharing. However	 these effects were not mirrored with customers. Instead	 greater supply chain integration with customers was significantly related to pollution control. Collectively	 these findings suggested that downstream supply chain members tend to favour prevention while simultaneously shifting the burden for control to upstream members.						
AB Background: The association between diet and fatty liver disease (FLD) has predominantly been analyzed for single nutrients or foods	 and findings have been inconsistent.															
AB Objective: A number of potential health effects have lately been accorded to tea consumption. It is	 however	 not clear whether an increase in tea consumption increases the risk of iron depletion in a normal apparently healthy adult population. We have therefore evaluated this.														
AB Although many in vitro and animal studies have suggested a protective effect of green tea against breast cancer	 findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. No study has used prediagnostic biomarkers of tea polyphenols	 which might play a protective role. A total of 24	226 women aged 40 to 69 years in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study who responded to the baseline questionnaire and provided blood in 1990-1995 were followed to December 2002. During a mean 10.6 years of follow-up	 144 newly diagnosed breast cancers were identified. Two matched controls for each case were selected from the cohort. Plasma levels of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC)	 (-)-epicatechin (EC)	 (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)	 and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) were measured	 and the odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer according to plasma level was estimated using a conditional logistic regression model. We found no statistically significant association between plasma tea polyphenol levels and breast cancer risk. Adjusted ORs for the highest versus lowest group were 0.90 (95% CI 0.42-1.96; P for trend = 0.98) for EGC	 0.95 (95% Cl 0.43-2.08; P for trend = 0.86) for EC	 1.21 (95% CI 0.52 2.80; P for trend = 0.53) for EGCG	 and 1.75 (95% CI 0.81-3.78; P for trend = 0.15) for ECG. Stratified analyses according to baseline menopausal status showed no remarkable difference between two strata. This nested case control study found no overall association between plasma tea polyphenols and the risk of breast cancer in Japan.					
AB Due to the growing concern over environmental issues	 regardless of whether companies are going to voluntarily incorporate green policies in practice	 or will be forced to do so in the context of new legislation	 change is foreseen in the future of transportation management. Assigning and scheduling vehicles to service a pre-determined set of clients is a common distribution problem. Accounting for time-dependent travel times between customers	 we present a model that considers travel time	 fuel	 and CO2 emissions costs. Specifically	 we propose a framework for modeling CO2 emissions in a time-dependent vehicle routing context. The model is solved via a tabu search procedure. As the amount of CO2 emissions is correlated with vehicle speed	 our model considers limiting vehicle speed as part of the optimization. The emissions per kilometer as a function of speed are minimized at a unique speed. However	 we show that in a time-dependent environment this speed is sub-optimal in terms of total emissions. This occurs if vehicles are able to avoid running into congestion periods where they incur high emissions. Clearly	 considering this trade-off in the vehicle routing problem has great practical potential. In the same line	 we construct bounds on the total amount of emissions to be saved by making use of the standard VRP solutions. As fuel consumption is correlated with CO2 emissions	 we show that reducing emissions leads to reducing costs. For a number of experimental settings	 we show that limiting vehicle speeds is desired from a total cost perspective. This namely stems from the trade-off between fuel and travel time costs.			
AB Objective To prospectively compare an indocyanine green (ICG)enhanced optical imaging system with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of synovitis in the hands of patients with rheumatologic disorders. Methods Forty-five patients (30 women [67%]	 mean +/- SD age 52.6 +/- 13.4 years) in whom there was a clinical suspicion of an inflammatory arthropathy were examined with a commercially available device for ICG-enhanced optical imaging as well as by contrast-enhanced 3T MRI as the standard of reference. Three independent readers graded the degree of synovitis in the carpal	 metacarpophalangeal	 proximal interphalangeal	 and distal interphalangeal joints of both hands (1	350 joints)	 using a 4-point ordinate scale (0 = no synovitis	 1 = mild	 2 = moderate	 3 = severe). Statistical analyses were performed using a logistic generalized estimating equation approach. Agreement of optical imaging ratings made by the different readers was estimated with a weighted kappa coefficient. Results When MRI was used as the standard of reference	 optical imaging showed a sensitivity of 39.6% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 31.148.7%)	 a specificity of 85.2% (95% CI 79.589.5%)	 and accuracy of 67.0% (95% CI 61.472.1%) for the detection of synovitis in patients with arthritis. Diagnostic accuracy was especially limited in the setting of mild synovitis	 while it was substantially better in patients with severely inflamed joints. Moderate interreader and intrareader agreement was observed. Conclusion The evaluated ICG-enhanced optical imaging system showed limitations for the detection of inflamed joints of the hand in comparison with MRI.			
AB Introduction During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) haemodilution occurs. Hepatic dysfunction after CPB is a rare	 but serious	 complication. Clinical data have validated the plasma-disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR ICG) as a marker of hepatic function and perfusion. Primary objective of this analysis was to investigate the impact of haemodilutional anaemia on hepatic function and perfusion by the time course of PDR ICG and liver enzymes in elective CABG surgery. Secondary objective was to define predictors of prolonged ICUtreatment like decreased PDR ICG after surgery.														
AB The period between fruit set and full ripening of araza fruit grown in the Colombian Amazonia was 55 +/- 5 days. Three stages of a sigmoidal growth were identified and longitudinal and equatorial traits fitted a logistic model better than three-degree polynomial models. Fruit growth clearly exhibited three different physiological stages	 identified as follows: S1	 involving cellular division during the first 14 days; S2	 maximum fruit growth	 during which cellular expansion took place (up to day 50)	 and a final S3 state of 5 days to reach physiological maturity. After this time	 the fruit can be harvested with a dull green coloration. Parenchyma was the principal fruit tissue	 and no support tissues (sclerenchyma or collenchyma) were evident. The respiratory pattern of araza fruit was climacteric	 with maximum respiration rates of around 200 mg CO2 kg(-1) h(-1)	 preceded by a peak of ethylene production (20 mu L C4H4 kg(-1) h(-1))	 a change in skin color from green to yellow	 a total soluble solids value of 5 degrees Brix	 an increase in the sucrose and fructose content up to 2.8 mu mol g(-1)	 a pH which increased to 3 units	 and a decrease in titratable acidity to 400 mmol H+ L1-. Malic acid was the main organic acid in the edible pulp and ascorbic acid was present in a concentration of 17.8 mu mol g(-1). Skin color (as measured by hue angle) combined with titratable acidity and fruit firmness can be recommended as harvest indices for araza fruit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.		
AB The purpose of this work was to study the population dynamics of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in orchards of 'Valencia' orange	 'Ponkan' mandarin	 and 'Murcott' tangor trees located at the Sao Jose farm in the municipality of Taquaritinga	 Sao Paulo (SP). Yellow sticky traps used to monitor this disease vector were evaluated monthly for 4 yr between Sep 2004 and Aug 2008. The largest number of D. citri was captured on the 'Ponkan' mandarin trees followed by the 'Murcott' tangor and 'Valencia' orange trees with significant differences. Chemical pest control and environmental factors likely are responsible for these results. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that there is a weak correlation between the abundance of D. citri and the environmental factors of temperature and precipitation. An analysis of variance suggested that there was a significant difference in the abundance of D. citri among the 3 citrus tree varieties	 and the autocorrelation was significant for the 'Valencia' orange orchard. Spectral analysis indicated that there were greater frequencies of peaks in the 'Ponkan' mandarin and 'Murcott' tangor trees	 and the simulations performed using a stochastic logistic model suggested that the psyllid populations on orange trees are the most susceptible to local extinction; this result likely occurred because of the high levels of chemical control applied to orange trees. Therefore	 in a D. citri management program	 the different citrus varieties planted on a farm should be considered	 thus varieties without the proper management of the vector does not become a source of psyllids for infestation of other varieties.								
AB This study analysed sea turtle strandings on the coast of Paraiba State	 Northeastern Brazil	 from August 2009 to July 2010. A total of 124 strandings were recorded in this period: green turtle Chelonia mydas (n = 106)	 hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata (n = 15)	 olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (n = 2) and loggerhead Caretta caretta (n = 1). Of all turtles for which the Curved Carapace Length (CCL) was measured (n = 122)	 only 12 individuals (9.7%) were adults. Twenty individuals had synthetic anthropogenic debris in the gastrointestinal tract. Other traces of human interactions were observed in 43 individuals	 such as injuries caused by entanglement in fishing lines or nets	 collisions with vessels	 direct contact with oil spills and lesions caused by sharp or spiked objects. Moreover	 in 28.5% of the stranded turtles	 the presence of external tumors was noticed	 suggestive of fibropapillomatosis and in 9.7%	 shark bite marks were observed. Of the 107 individuals that were sexed	 76 were females and 31 were males. Most turtles (72.6%) became stranded during the spring/summer (between October and March). We found evidence of human interactions (injuries) in half of the strandings	 but in most cases it was not possible to determine if such interactions were the cause of death. A logistic regression found a significant relationship between CCL	 ingestion of debris and lesions caused by sharks or spiked objects. Systematic data collection from stranded sea turtles can provide useful biological information	 such as seasonal and spatial patterns in their occurrence and mortality
AB Properly calibrated diagnostic tools are needed to evaluate the performance of different N management practices for corn (Zea mays L.). Until now	 mostly controlled studies were used for such calibrations. We utilized on-farm evaluation studies to verify current and identify new N status categories using the corn stalk nitrate test (CSNT) and late-season digital aerial imagery of the corn canopy. From 2007 through 2010	 producers conducted 125 trials across Iowa. Each trial had treatments of a producer's normal N rate alternated with a rate that was about one-third lower or higher. Categorical yield response (YR)	 expressed as profitable and unprofitable	 was related to green reflectance (GR)	 relative green reflectance (RGR)	 or CSNT sampled within nine areas in each trial. Multilevel binary logistic regressions were used to estimate the probability of receiving profitable YR for a range of CSNT	 RGR	 and GR values. Among the three diagnostics	 RGR performed slightly better but required applying at least two N rates within producers' fields. For CSNT	 the identified optimal category was almost the same as that currently recommended in Iowa (700-2000 mg NO3-N kg(-1))	 even when corn and N prices deviated from their long-term averages by 30%. Due to the uncertainty in N availability	 however	 the critical CSNT value for fall manure treatments was about 3000 mg NO3-N kg(-1) higher than that for fall anhydrous NH3	 spring urea-NH4NO3	 or sidedress N. On-farm studies can be used to calibrate late-season N diagnostic tools for evaluating management practices that differ in rates	 forms
AB Objective: To test whether adherence to non-ergot	 once-daily dopamine agonist (ODDA) therapy depends upon concomitant levodopa daily dose in Parkinson's disease (PD).															
AB Background: Fever is one of the most common symptoms among children and is usually caused by respiratory infections. Although Japanese health authorities have long recommended gargling to prevent respiratory infections	 its effectiveness among children is not clear.															
AB Renewable resources pose special challenges to process synthesis. Due to decentral raw material generation	 usually low transport densities and the perishable character of most renewable raw materials in combination with their time dependent availability	 logistical questions as well as adaptation to regional agricultural structures are necessary. This calls for synthesis of structures not only of single processes but of the whole value chain attached to the utilisation of a certain resource. As most of the innovative technologies proposed to build on a renewable raw material base face stiff economic competition from fossil based processes	 economic optimality of the value chain is crucial to their implementation. On top of this widening of the process definition for synthesis	 many processes on the base of renewable resources apply technologies (like membrane separations	 chromatographic purification steps	 etc.) for which the heuristic knowledge is still slim. This reduces the choice of methods for process synthesis	 mainly to methods based on combinatorial principles. The paper investigates applicability as well as impact on technology development of process synthesis for renewable raw material utilisation. It takes logistic considerations into account and applies process synthesis to the case study of the green biorefinery concept.									
AB Purpose:: We Sought to evaluate the link between long-term tea intake and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus	 in a sample of elderly adults. Materials and Methods: During 20052007	 300 men and women from Cyprus	 142 from Mitilini	 100 from Samothraki	 114 from Kefalonia	 131 from Crete	 150 from Corfu and 103 from Zakynthos (aged 65 to 100 years) were enrolled. Dietary habits (including tea consumption) were assessed through a food frequency questionnaire. Among various factors	 fasting blood glucose was measured and prevalence of (type 2) diabetes mellitus was estimated. Results: 54% of the participants reported that they consume tea at least once a week (mean intake 1.64 +/- 1.1 cup/day). The majority of the participants (98%) reported green or black tea consumption. The participants reported that they consume tea for at least 30 years of their lire. After adjusting for various confounders	 tea intake was inversely associated with lower blood glucose levels (b +/- SEM per 1 cup: -5.9 +/- 2.6mg/dL	 p=0.02). Moreover	 Multiple logistic regression revealed that moderate tea consumption (1 - 2 cups/day) was associated with 70% (95% CI 41% to 86%) lower odds of having (type 2) diabetes	 irrespective of age	 sex	 body mass	 smoking	 physical activity status
AB Background: Data regarding the effects of tea	 coffee	 and milk on the risk of colorectal cancer are inconsistent. We investigated associations of tea	 coffee	 and milk consumption with colorectal cancer risk and attempted to determine if these exposures were differentially associated with the risks of proximal colon	 distal colon	 and rectal cancers.										
AB Eradication and control of invasive species are often possible only if populations are detected when they are small and localized. To be efficient	 detection surveys should be targeted at locations where there is the greatest risk of incursions. We examine the utility of habitat suitability index (HSI) and particle dispersion models for targeting; sampling for marine pests. Habitat suitability index models are a simple way to identify suitable habitat when species distribution data are lacking. We compared the performance of HSI models with statistical models derived from independent data from New Zealand on the distribution of two nonindigenous bivalves: Theora lubrica and Musculista senhousia. Logistic regression models developed using the HSI scores as predictors of the presence/absence of Theora and Musculista explained 26.7% and 6.2% of the deviance in the data	 respectively. Odds ratios for the HSI scores were greater than unity	 indicating that they were genuine predictors of the presence/ absence of each species. The fit and predictive accuracy of each logistic model were improved when simulated patterns of dispersion from the nearest port were added as a predictor variable. Nevertheless	 the combined model explained	 at best	 46.5% of the deviance in the distribution of Theora and correctly predicted 56% of true presences and 50% of all cases. Omission errors were between 6% and 16%. Although statistical distribution models built directly from environmental predictors always outperformed the equivalent HSI models	 the gain in model fit and accuracy was modest. High residual deviance in both types of model suggests that the distributions realized by Theora and Musculista in the field data were influenced by factors not explicitly modeled as explanatory variables and by encor in the environmental data used to project suitable habitat for the species. Our results highlight the difficulty of accurately predicting the distribution of invasive marine species that exhibit low habitat occupancy and patchy distributions in time and space. Although the HSI and statistical models had utility as predictors of the likely distribution of nonindigenous marine species	 the level of spatial accuracy achieved with them may be well below expectations for sensitive surveillance programs.								
AB AIM: To investigate the effect of different colour three-dimensional (3D) displays on polyp detection at virtual colonoscopy (VC).																
AB The presence of phytoplankton	 like other particulate organic matter	 can interfere with the effects of hydrophobic contaminants such as pyrethroid pesticides. However	 the reduction or elimination of toxicity by algae added as food during testing is not taken into account in standard US EPA whole effluent toxicity (WET) zooplankton tests. On the other hand	 WET test conditions may overestimate toxicity of such compounds in highly productive surface waters with high concentrations of detritus and other particulate matter. In addition	 WET tests do not measure impaired swimming ability or predator avoidance behavior as an indicator of increased mortality risk. This study used a modified version of the US EPA WET Ceriodaphnia dubia acute test to investigate the effects of phytoplankton on toxicity of the pyrethroid insecticide	 esfenvalerate. Animals were exposed simultaneously to different concentrations of esfenvalerate and green algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Mortality and predation risk were recorded after 4 and 24 h. Algae at or below concentrations specified in the WET protocol significantly reduced mortality. Regardless	 organisms exposed to esfenvalerate were unable to avoid simulated predation in the presence of algae at any concentration. After 12 h	 esfenvalerate adsorbed to algae represented 68-99 % of the total amount recovered. The proportion of algae-bound insecticide increased with algal concentration indicating that conclusions drawn from toxicity tests in which algae are added as food must be interpreted with caution as the dissolved fraction of such hydrophobic contaminants is reduced. Additionally	 our results strongly suggest that the EPA should consider adding ecologically-relevant endpoints such as swimming behavior to standard WET protocols.							
AB PURPOSE. P1 is the major positive component of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PR-VEPs). The rapid decrease of its latency correlates with the progressive myelination in the developing infant brain	 which affects signal transmission in the visual system. An age-dependent phase shift	 analogous to P1 peak latency	 can be observed in dynamic random dot correlogram (DRDC)-evoked VEPs (DRDC-VEPs)	 a method used to assess binocular function. Our goal was to study the relationship between cyclopean DRDC-VEP phases and PR-VEP P1 latencies in full-term and preterm infants so as to further explore the experience dependence of early binocular developmental processes.												
AB Although several studies have assessed the association between total fluid intake	 specific drinks and bladder cancer	 no firm conclusions can yet be drawn. Four hundred thirty two bladder cancer cases and 392 frequency matched hospital-based controls recruited in the South and East of China between October 2005 and June 2008 were interviewed on their intake of 6 nonalcoholic and 3 alcoholic drinks. Age	 sex	 smoking and hospital-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95% Cl) were calculated for all drinks and for total fluid intake using logistic regression. For 381 cases (81.9% men) and 371 controls (76.3% men)	 total fluid intake could be calculated. In men	 an increase in total fluid intake was associated with a significantly decreased bladder cancer risk (OR 0.93	 95% Cl: 0.88-0.99	 per cup fluid consumed). Neither green nor black tea consumption was associated with bladder cancer. Daily consumption of milk significantly reduced the risk of bladder cancer by a half (OR 0.49	 95% Cl: 0.32-0.76)	 which strengthens earlier suggestions that milk is probably associated with a decreased bladder cancer risk. Consumption of wine (OR 0.49	 95% Cl: 0.34-0.70) and liquor/spirits (OR 0.65	 95% Cl: 0.47-0.92) were associated with a significantly reduced risk. Consumption of water	 fruit juice and beer appeared not associated with bladder cancer. There is no clear indication that the risks observed in this Chinese population are substantially different from those observed in Caucasian populations.			
AB One promising approach for early detection of lung cancer is by monitoring gene promoter hypermethylation events in sputum. Epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary fruits and vegetables and the micronutrients they contain may reduce risk of lung cancer. In this study	 we evaluated whether diet and multivitamin use influenced the prevalence of gene promoter methylation in cells exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract of current and former smokers. Members (N = 1	101) of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort completed the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire and provided a sputum sample that was assessed for promoter methylation of eight genes commonly silenced in lung cancer and associated with risk for this disease. Methylation status was categorized as low (fewer than two genes methylated) or high (two or more genes methylated). Logistic regression models were used to identify associations between methylation status and 21 dietary variables hypothesized to affect the acquisition of gene methylation. Significant protection against methylation was observed for leafy green vegetables [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83 per 12 monthly servings; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)	 0.74-0.93] and folate (OR	 0.84 per 750 mu g/d; 95% CI	 0.72-0.99). Protection against gene methylation was also seen with current use of multivitamins (OR	 0.57; 95% CI	 0.40-0.83). This is the first cohort-based study to identify dietary factors associated with reduced promoter methylation in cells exfoliated from the airway epithelium of smokers. Novel interventions to prevent lung cancer should be developed based on the ability of diet and dietary supplements to affect reprogramming of the epigenome. Cancer Res; 70(2); 568-74.

AB Objective: Family meals have been negatively associated with overweight in children	 while television (TV) viewing during meals has been associated with a poorer diet. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of eating family breakfast and dinner	 and having a TV on during dinner	 with overweight in nine European countries and whether these associations differed between Northern and Southern & Eastern Europe.													
AB Whole-plant bioassays using sugar beet	 lettuce	 cucumber	 green bean	 pea	 and soybean as test crops were used to detect mesotrione residues in the soil. The test crops were planted in soil treated with mesotrione in the field the previous year at rates of 0 to 560 g ai ha(-1) and in nontreated soil from the same field	 with mesotrione added at concentrations of 0 to 320 mu g kg(-1). Experiments were conducted in the greenhouse for a 21-d period. Values for the dose giving a 50% response (I-50) were predicted using a log-logistic nonlinear regression model. I-50 values (mean +/- SE) of 8.6 +/- 1.8	 14.9 +/- 2.0	 29.8 +/- 11.0	 41.6 +/- 7.3	 52.9 +/- 6.4	 and 67.9 +/- 30.3 g ai ha(-1) for sugar beet	 lettuce	 green bean	 cucumber	 pea	 and soybean
AB Chlamydiosis is a naturally occurring	 contagious and zoonotic disease caused by Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci)	 affecting humans as well as domestic and wild birds globally but little is known about C. psittaci infection in peafowls in China. The objective of the present investigation was therefore to examine C. psittaci seroprevalence in. peafowls in Yunnan province	 Southwestern China. Serum samples from 270 peafowls including 265 blue peafowls and 5 green peafowls originated from Kunming city and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (Banna for short) were collected in 2011 to 201 2 and examined independently for the presence of antibodies to C. psittaci by the Indirect Hemagglutination Assay (IHA). In this survey	 antibodies to C. psittaci were found in. 84 of 270 (31.11%) peafowls. Both green peafowls (Pavo muticus) (2/5) and blue peafowls (Pavo cristatus) (30.94% of 265) were positive for C. psittaci antibody and peafowl from zoos in Kunming had higher seroprevalence (52.70% of 74) than those from peafowl gardens in Banna (22.96% of 196 samples) but the difference was not statistically significant by logistic regression analysis (p>0.05). Significant difference was observed among age groups	 the prevalence in adult peafowls (86.36% of 44) was significantly higher than that in. adolescent birds (5.73% of 157) (p<0.01	 OR = 104.148	 95% CI = 34.920-310.620). There were no statistical interactions between ages and geographical origins of peafowl (p>0.05). The results indicated a wide distribution of C. psittaci infections among peafowls in Yunnan	 Southwestern China	 posing significant public health concerns. To the knowledge	 this is the first report of C. psittaci infection in. peafowls in Yunnan province	 Southwestern China.					
AB Objective: To investigate differences between dietary habits in Glasgow and those in the rest of Scotland and the role that socio-economic factors have in explaining these.																
AB Objective To verify whether ocular surface tests other than those included in primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS-I) classification criteria (Schirmer I	 Break up Time	 vital dye staining) may contribute to SS I diagnosis.														
AB Forecasting the range expansion of nonindigenous organisms enables effective quarantine and the development of pre-arrival countermeasures	 as well as raises public and scientific concerns among the general public. Here	 we present an approach to forecasting the range expansion of the nonindigenous green crab Carcinus in Japanese waters	 with consideration of the human-mediated shipping and natural dispersal. Two types of shipping	 namely	 primary transport to Japan via long-distance ocean-going shipping and secondary transport within Japan via short-distance coastal shipping	 were considered. The presence and absence of the crab in 50-km shoreline segments were obtained at 5 year intervals from 1985 to 2005	 based on observation records by professional and amateur naturalists. Two types of dispersal kernel	 namely	 conventional logistic regression and a multiplicative immigration model considering multiple pathways explicitly	 were compared. The multiplicative immigration model gave significantly better results. Natural dispersal was the most significant factor	 in spite of its low expansion rate: secondary transport by coastal shipping was the second. Transport by international ocean-going shipping was not statistically significant	 suggesting quite a small immigration probability of the crab by long voyages. Stochastic simulations forecasted that the crab will invade most of the coasts of western Japan along the Pacific Ocean and Seto Inland Sea by 2055	 and will become widespread all over the country by 2205. Quarantine scenarios to eliminate transport by vessels revealed that preventing crab transport by domestic coastal vessels may delay the arrival of crabs in Hokkaido and the northern Japan area by 700 years at maximum.			
AB Natural oil from non-food oil seeds	 such as camelina	 jatropha	 and pennycress	 is increasingly becoming the feedstock of choice for biodiesel production through transesterification to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and green diesel via catalytic hydrotreating. Unlike the presscakes from food-based feedstocks	 such as soy and palm fruits	 the residual oil-extracted presscakes are often not suitable for consumption as animal feed. However	 their abundance and the fact that these feedstocks are already collected give them a logistic advantage as a bioenergy resource over conventional lignocellulosic biomass	 which is yet to be harvested. Vegetable oil-seed presscakes make an ideal thermochemical conversion feedstock because of their inherently high initial calorific value. We carried out fast pyrolysis of the entire value chain of two of the mustard family oil seeds	 pennycress and camelina	 and found that	 at the optimum fast pyrolysis conditions	 not only can high-carbon	 high-energy liquid fuel intermediates be produced but also these liquids are low-oxygen	 stable intermediates that do not oligomerize over time to higher molecular weight or increase in viscosity over time according to the accelerated aging test. Liquid fuel quality was high	 with gross calorific value ranging between 29.0 MJ/kg for defatted oil to 34.7 MJ/kg for the whole seed on a dry basis. The corresponding carbon conversion efficiency	 defined as feed carbon converted to the liquid pyrolysate
AB Phenological observations have a long tradition. By contrast	 digital webcam-based phenological research has only developed in recent years	 prompted by the development of cheaper user-friendly digital camera systems and by higher staff costs. Webcam photography provides spectral information in red	 green and blue (RGB) wavelengths which mirror the seasonal colour changes in trees during bud burst	 leaf unfolding	 senescence and leaf fall.											
AB Based on institutional theory and resource based view	 this study seeks to examine linkages among institutional pressures	 environmental innovation practices and performance. Specially	 we test the moderating effect of resource commitment on the consequences of environmental innovation practices. We collected data from 148 manufacturers in Pearl River Delta	 China to test the theoretical model. The statistical results reveal that institutional pressures coming from government's command-and-control instrument	 overseas customer pressure and competitive pressure exert significant positive impact on environmental innovation practices	 while government's economic incentive instrument and domestic customer pressure do not work. We also find environmental innovation practices have significant positive impact on firms' environmental performance	 while the effect on financial performance should be through the mediating role of environmental performance. The further analysis reveals that the relationship between environmental innovation practices and financial performance is moderated by the level of resource commitment. As resource commitment increases	 the financial performance yielded from environmental innovation practices will be better. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.								
AB Purpose: To investigate the incidence of and risk factors for a dissociated optic nerve fiber layer (DONFL) appearance after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 189 eyes that underwent PPV with internal limiting membrane removal and judged the presence/absence of an apparent DONFL based on en face layer images produced by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Results: An apparent DONFL was observed in 47 (24.9%) eyes. The incidence of an apparent DONFL was significantly higher in the macular hole (MH) group (76.5%) than in the non-MH group (epiretinal membrane	 diabetic macular edema	 retinal vein occlusion	 and others; 4.9%; p < 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis	 surgical indication for MH was identified as the most significant DONFL risk factor (odds ratio 63.7; p = 1.05 x 10(-8)). Conclusion: Postoperative OCT en face layer imaging clarified that MH eyes are liable to have an apparent DONFL following PPV. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG	 Basel											
AB The paradigm of the green economy has contributed to raising the attention paid to developing sustainability-oriented strategies for supply chain (SC) management. The responsibility of producers to extend and reverse SCs is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over the way firms can adapt their business models to interlinking technical	 socio-economic and environmental frameworks. This is particularly true when producers are not also reuse/recycle actors. By performing a critical review of the scientific literature on this field	 this article develops nine elemental factors that can be considered for assessing the impacts of collaborative strategies as a means to implement extended producer responsibility (EPR) in open-loop SCs. The resulting conceptual framework provides EPR implementation guidance under different market conditions. Inter-organizational relationships are found to present both opportunities and threats that can be profitably managed under a systemic perspective. Implications for management and needs for further research are discussed. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons	 Ltd and ERP Environment.													
AB The objectives for energy saving in the housing sector set by recent Swedish energy and climate policies are quite demanding. This article uses nation-wide Swedish survey data from 2004 to 2007 to explore the potential for achieving those targets. Earlier findings that socio-economic characteristics such as age	 housing type and income are strongly linked to higher propensities to save on heating and hot water usage are confirmed by ordered logistic regression models. However	 general environmental attitudes are also found to play a crucial role. When assessing the relative importance of socioeconomic factors and environmental attitudes	 the effect on energy saving is generally greater for the former than the latter. In addition	 important interaction effects are identified. In relative terms	 the effect of environmental attitudes is clearly stronger among households in apartment blocks than among those in detached housing	 and stronger among households with higher income than among those with lower income. We end by discussing the implications for the selection and targeting of policy measures to tap the energy savings potential in the population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.										
AB Consumers in today's world can perceive an additional benefit associated with responsible business practices and the sustainability of purchased products. However	 in Scandinavian context	 there is a lack of knowledge of consumer perceptions toward environmental and social sustainability of wood products. Our data on adult Finnish consumers (private end-users) (N=227) were collected during 2004-2007 as interview exit data from home retail centers selling building materials. The perceived environmental and social sustainability of wood products was investigated using exploratory factor analysis	 and the phenomenon was observed to be a two-dimensional construct consisting of General environmental and social sustainability and Specific social sustainability reflecting strong consumer need for product safety. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the General dimension also explains the consumer's self-declared willingness to pay for sustainable wood products. The results also indicate that the respondents may be segmented based on their perceptions on product level environmental and social sustainability: the most environmentally and socially conscious group can be profiled by gender (female)	 older age	 and summer cottage ownership.											
AB In the desert locust	 Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal) (Orthoptera: Acrididae)	 the threshold density inducing the gregarization phenomenon has never been determined under natural conditions. The influence of environmental factors on this phenomenon has been studied mostly in controlled environments. Based on data collected during several years by the survey teams of the National Center for Locust Control in Mauritania	 we analyzed the influence of locust density	 vegetation cover	 and vegetation status on the probability of observing gregarious locusts. We assumed that a probability to observe gregarious locusts of 0.5 corresponded to the density threshold of gregarization. The results showed in detail the change in the threshold of gregarization according to the cover and status of the vegetation. Low cover and dry vegetation led to a low density threshold of gregarization probably due to high probability of individuals to touch each other. Dense and green vegetation favored a high threshold of gregarization probably due to a dispersion of the individuals and a low probability of individual encounters. These findings should help the management of locusts and decision making during control operations.											
AB Promoter hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) gene was investigated in 52 sets of samples of tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue from Korean patients with colorectal cancer	 using the proposed modified the Real-time PCR/SYBR Green detection method presented in this study. In normal tissue	 29 of 52 patients (56%) were methylated and in tumor tissue	 23 of 52 patients (44%) were methylated. The 34 cases (65.4%) showed a concordant DNA methylation pattern in both normal tissue and tumor tissue. Analyzing the association between the clinicopathologic features and DNA methylation status of the p16(INK4a) gene	 the DNA methylation status according to by Duke's stage was different while other clinicopathological characteristics	 including the age	 sex	 tumor stage	 and histologic type of the patient were not found to be correlated with p16(INK4a) methylation. With multivariate logistic regression	 it was observed that the DNA methylation status of p16(INK4a) gene in normal tissue was correlated with the DNA methylation status of the p16(INK4a) gene in tumor tissue (P= 0.026). According to a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis	 a difference in the survival rate by DNA methylation status was found	 but it was not significant.					
AB Though services and product-service systems have been promoted as a promising way towards more eco-efficient and sustainable societies	 they have not turned into reality as expected. Chemical and resource management services are among the few operational examples. They aim to align the service provider's and customer's actions to reduce chemical usage and waste	 improve supply chain management and increase resource efficiency. Arguably	 they also create new business and higher profit margins compared with merely selling chemicals or handling industrial waste. Thus far they have been viewed as a single business model. In contrast	 this study shows through the construction of five ideal types that the actual services and their focus vary. They range from the management of the chemical supply to operations	 waste reduction	 combined logistics services	 process management	 IT and other technologies. Consequently this affects the value creation	 organization and environmental efficiencies of these services. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons	 Ltd and ERP Environment.						
AB Empirical research on the characteristics of environmentally responsive companies has focussed on US and Japanese companies. For Europe	 which is commonly considered as the greenest of the three major markets	 similar research is lacking. This paper seeks to fill this gap by empirically investigating business and financial characteristics	 stakeholder pressures and public policies to distinguish companies that have implemented the European Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) from a unique firm-level dataset of European publicly quoted companies. We find that the EMAS participation decision is positively influenced by the solvency ratio	 the share of non-current liabilities	 the average labour cost and the absolute company size as well as the relative size of a company compared to its sector average. The profit margin exerts a negative influence. We further find that companies whose headquarters is located in a country that actively encourages EMAS have a higher probability of participation. Finally	 this paper suggests that rather than attracting other kinds of companies	 a favourable institutional context succeeds in convincing more of the same kind of companies to participate.									
AB In shotgun sequencing	 statistical reconstruction of a consensus from alignment requires a model of measurement error. Churchill and Waterman proposed one such model and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate sequencing error rates for each assembly matrix. Ewing and Green defined Phred quality scores for base-calling from sequencing traces by training a model on a large amount of data. However	 sample preparations and sequencing machines may work under different conditions in practice and therefore quality scores need to be adjusted. Moreover	 the information given by quality scores is incomplete in the sense that they do not describe error patterns. We observe that each nucleotide base has its specific error pattern that varies across the range of quality values. We develop models of measurement error for shotgun sequencing by combining the two perspectives above. We propose a logistic model taking quality scores as covariates. The model is trained by a procedure combining an EM algorithm and model selection techniques. The training results in calibration of quality values and leads to a more accurate construction of consensus. Besides Phred scores obtained from ABI sequencers	 we apply the same technique to calibrate quality values that come along with Beckman sequencers.												
AB The use of injected stem cells	 leading to regeneration of ischemic heart tissue	 for example	 following coronary artery occlusion	 has emerged as a major new option for managing 'heart attack' patients. While some clinical trials have been encouraging	 there have also been failures and there is little understanding of the multiplicity of factors that lead to the outcome. In this overview paper	 the opportunities and challenges in applying biophotonic techniques to regenerative medicine	 exemplified by the challenge of stem cell therapy of ischemic heart disease	 are considered. The focus is on optical imaging to track stem cell distribution and fate	 and optical spectroscopies and/or imaging to monitor the structural remodeling of the tissue and the resulting functional changes. The scientific	 technological	 and logistics issues involved in moving some of these techniques from pre-clinical research mode ultimately into the clinic are also highlighted.					
AB Growing interest in sustainability and corporate supply chains accompanies increased globalisation across developed and developing countries	 a stronger focus on the logistics of procurement behind international trade	 and information flows between parties about corporate economic	 social and environmental performance. Accounting provides information to oil the wheels of supply chain relationships. The purpose of this paper is to consider what an accounting for sustainability of production and supply chains might look like. An overview is provided of the issues associated with a broadening of accounting needed for sustainable supply chains. The paper highlights: ongoing problems of scope and terminology	 lack of a broad sustainability focus because of complexity which stunts the impact on decision makers	 and the need for transdisciplinary teams to increase connectedness and performance of the supply chain. The need for further research relating to three issues is identified. First	 who undertakes the accounting for supply chains; second	 why should a business function account for supply chain involvement; and	 third	 what information is relevant to different functional managers?

AB The aims were to determine the reliability of ultrasound elastography (USE) and the factors related to reliability. One hundred six solid thyroid nodules in 78 consecutive patients were enrolled. Conventional ultrasound examination and USE were performed for each nodule. We evaluated reliability	 the factors affecting reliability of USE and the interobserver and intraobserver agreement. We suggest following three criteria as less reliable results: (1) <50% green color in the region of interest box for the thyroid parenchyma; (2) discordance in elasticity scores in the three USE images; and (3) intranodular color signal loss. Consensual reliability of USE was 68% (72/106). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that rim calcification (p = 0.002)	 a compressive force of >= 3 (p < 0.001) and arterial pulsation (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with reliability of USE. Substantial interobserver (kappa = 0.738) and intraobserver agreement were observed in reliable USE results (kappa = 0.765). Clinical application of USE should be restricted to the thyroid nodules with reliable results.

AB Efficient transport of timber for supplying industrial conversion and biomass power plants is a crucial factor for competitiveness in the forest industry. Throughout the recent years minimizing driving times has been the main focus of optimizations in this field. In addition to this aim the objective of reducing environmental impacts	 represented by carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions	 is discussed. The underlying problem is formulated as a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery and time windows (MDVRPPDTW) and a new iterative solution method is proposed. For the numerical studies	 real-life data are used to generate test instances of different scales concerning the supply chain of biomass power plants. Small ones are taken to validate the optimality of the new approach. Medium and large test instances are solved with respect to minimizing driving times and fuel consumptions separately. This study shows that the selection of the objective of minimizing fuel consumption leads to a significant reduction of CO(2)e emissions compared to a minimization of driving times.													
AB Background: Throughout the world	 asthma can be a life-threatening disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is commonly used among Taiwanese adults to control many diseases.															
AB Objectives: To evaluate the associated risk factors of probable overactive bladder (OAB) and to determine the effect of OAB on quality of life through validated questionnaires in Turkish midwifery students.																
   Results: The participants' mean age was 21.74 +/- 2.15 years. The prevalence of OAB was 35.4%. There was a significant relationship between the presence of probable DAB and familial urinary incontinence history and childhood nocturnal enuresis. In the logistic regression analysis	 family history was associated with an OR of 2.11 (95% CI: 1.08-4.10) for OAB	 and nocturia with an OR of 2.69 (95% CI: 1.16-6.21) for OAB. Drinking moderate amounts of tea and carbonated drinks daily did not affect DAB	 but extreme consumption of these beverages was associated with an OR of 2.98 (95% CI: 1.26-7.03) for DAB. DAB significantly worsens quality of life according to all the quality of life indices.													
   Conclusion: DAB is not a rare condition among young people. It appears that the quality of life was adversely influenced by OAB among both younger and older people. Familial urinary incontinence and childhood nocturnal enuresis were found to be risk factors for DAB. There is insufficient evidence to restrict tea or carbonated drinks consumption in young people with OAB unless their consumption is extreme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Texture analysis and modeling are important techniques in food and postharvest research and industrial practice. A wide range of methods have been used to evaluate instrumental results	 which provide time-series data of product deformation	 thereby allowing a wide range of texture attributes to be calculated from force-time or force-displacement data. Several indices of texture such as the firmness index	" crunchiness index and texture index based on ""vibration energy density"" have been reported"	 but these are not widely used to quantify food texture. Some modeling and statistical approaches have been adopted to analyze food texture data	 including chemical reaction kinetics and the Michaelis-Menton type decay function	 mechanistic autocatalytic models based on logistic equation	 and the finite element method. However	 increasing demand for comprehensive approaches to texture profile analysis	 generalized texture indices and fundamental texture models still remain challenges in the food research and industry.

AB Many factors affect the number of birds detected on point count surveys of breeding songbirds. The magnitude and importance of these factors are not well understood. We used a bird song simulation system to quantify the effects of detection distance	 singing rate	 species differences	 and observer differences on detection probabilities of birds detected by ear. We simulated 40 point counts consisting of 10 birds per count for five primary species ( Black- and- white Warbler Mniotilta varia	 Black- throated Blue Warbler Dendroica caerulescens	 Black- throated Green Warbler Dendroica virens	 Hooded Warbler Wilsonia citrina	 and Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus) over a range of 15 distances ( 34 - 143 m). Songs were played at low ( two songs per count) and high ( 13 - 21 songs per count) singing rates. Detection probabilities averaged across observers ranged from 0.60 ( Black- and- white Warbler) to 0.83 ( Hooded Warbler) at the high singing rate and 0.41 ( Black- and- white Warbler) to 0.67 ( Hooded Warbler) at the low singing rate. Logistic regression analyses indicated that species	 singing rate	 distance	 and observer were all significant factors affecting detection probabilities. Singing rate 3 species and singing rate 3 distance interactions were also signi. cant. Simulations of expected counts	 based on the best logistic model	 indicated that observers detected between 19% ( for the worst observer	 lowest singing rate	 and least detectable species) and 65% ( for the best observer	 highest singing rate	 and most detectable species) of the true population. Detection probabilities on actual point count surveys are likely to vary even more because many sources of variability were controlled in our experiments. These findings strongly support the importance of adjusting measures of avian diversity or abundance from auditory point counts with direct estimates of detection probability.
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the use of temporary storage offered by intermodal transshipment points to position some stock of fast moving consumer goods in advance of demand; this floating stock concept combines transport and inventory management. Intermodal transport is compared with direct road transport for a supply chain.																
AB Methiozolin is a new herbicide from South Korea currently under development in the United States for PRE and POST annual bluegrass control in bentgrass and most other cool- and warm-season turfgrasses. Greenhouse studies were conducted in 2012 at the University of California	 Riverside	 CA	 and Auburn University	 Auburn	 AL	 to evaluate the relative tolerance of three bentgrass species comprised of nine creeping bentgrass (CRBG) cultivars	 velvet bentgrass (VBG) and colonial bentgrass (COBG) to methiozolin at 0	 0.6	 1.1	 2.2	 4.5 and 9.0 kg ai ha(-1). Methiozolin was applied 7 wk after seeding	 followed by a second application 5 wk later. Methiozolin rates that produced 25 % injury (TI25) and 50% clipping dry weight reduction (GR(50)) relative to a nontreated control for each species or cultivar were calculated using four-parameter logistic regression. Turf injury rates at 21 d after second treatment (DAT2) were the most consistent in describing relative tolerance among bentgrass species. Overall	 CRBG was more tolerant to methiozolin than VBG or COBG. After two applications	 methiozolin rates that caused TI25 were 1.1	 0.2	 and 0.3 kg ha(-1) for GREG (across all cultivars)
AB Purpose: To identify the prevalence	 risk factors	 and subtypes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a screened South Korean population. Methods: A total of 10	890 participants (aged 50-92) who underwent a health check-up at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from January to December 2006 were included. Fundus photographs and systemic risk factors were assessed. Subtype frequencies of neovascular AMD were recorded according to angiograms. AMD was defined in accord with the international classification and grading system. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AMD. Results: The mean age of the 10	890 participants was 57.2 +/- 6.3 years (50-92 years)	 and 56.2% were men. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was 5.07%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR per 10-year increment	 2.22) and high blood pressure (adjusted OR: 1.35) were independent risk factors for early AMD. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of late AMD was 0.34%. Only age was significantly associated with late AMD. Of 9 exudative AMD patients who received fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography	 6 eyes (66.7%) showed choroidal neovascularization	 2 eyes (22.2%) had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)	 and 1 eye (11.1%) had retinal angiomatous proliferation. Conclusion: In this study	 the prevalence of early AMD was similar to other studies though the prevalence of late AMD was low. High blood pressure as well as age was a risk factor of early AMD. South Koreans may have a higher prevalence of PCV than white populations. These findings provide preliminary information for further investigation of AMD in South Koreans.						
AB Olive (Olea europaea L.) is the main perennial Spanish crop. Soil management in olive orchards is mainly based on intensive and tillage operations	 which have a great relevancy in terms of negative environmental impacts. Due to this reason	 the European Union (EU) only subsidizes cropping systems which require the implementation of conservation agro-environmental techniques such as cover crops between the rows. Remotely sensed data could offer the possibility of a precise follow-up of presence of cover crops to control these agrarian policy actions	 but firstly	 it is crucial to explore the potential for classifying variations in spectral signatures of olive trees	 bare soil and cover crops using field spectroscopy. In this paper	 we used hyperspectral signatures of bare soil	 olive trees	 and sown and dead cover crops taken in spring and summer in two locations to evaluate the potential of two methods (MultiLogistic regression with Initial and Radial Basis Function covariates	 MLIRBF; and SimpleLogistic regression with Initial and Radial Basis Function covariates	 SLIRBF) for classifying them in the 400-900 nm spectrum. These methods are based on a MultiLogistic regression model formed by a combination of linear and radial basis function neural network models. The estimation of the coefficients of the model is carried out basically in two phases. First	 the number of radial basis functions and the radii and centres' vector are determined by means of an evolutionary neural network algorithm. A maximum likelihood optimization method determines the rest of the coefficients of a MultiLogistic regression with a set of covariates that include the initial variables and the radial basis functions previously estimated. Finally	 we apply forward step-wise techniques of structural simplification.				
AB Background: Small nodules (<3 cm) detected on ultrasound (US) in cirrhotics represent the most challenging category for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aim: To evaluate real-time sonoelastography as a noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of small HCC nodules in cirrhotic patients. Methods: 42 cirrhotic patients with 58 nodules (1-3 cm) were evaluated with real-time elastography (Hitachi EUB-6500); the mean intensity of colors red	 blue	 green were measured using a semi-quantitative method. Analysis of histograms for each color of the sonoelastography images was performed for quantifying the elasticity of nodule tissue in comparison with the cirrhotic liver tissue. AUROC curves were constructed to define the best cut-off points to distinguish malignant features of the nodules. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: 595 sonoelastography images from 42 patients (25 men; 17 women) were analyzed. The mean age was 56.4 +/- 10.7 years and 69% patients were in Child-Pugh class A	 19% class B. 11% class C. For the mean intensity of green color A UROC=0.81	 a cut-off value of <108.7 being diagnostic for FICC with a Sp=91.1%	 Se=50%	 PPV=92.1%	 NPV=47.1%. Mean intensity of blue color proved to be an excellent diagnostic tool for HCC (AUROC=0.94); for a cut-off value>128.9	 Sp=92.2%	 Se=78.9%	 PPV=95.4%	 NPV=68%. Independent predictive factors of FICC for a small nodule in cirrhotic patients were: blue color>128.9 at sonoelastography and hypervascular appearance at Doppler US. Conclusions: US elastography is a promising method for the non-invasive diagnosis of early HCC. Blue color at elastography and hypervascular aspects are independent predictors of HCC.					
AB Current remote sensing studies of phenology have been limited to coarse spatial or temporal resolution and often lack a direct link to field measurements. To address this gap	 we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive field measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices	 five mathematical fits to model a continuous temporal response	" and a suite of threshold estimates for ""start of spring/season"" (SOS) assessments were compared to field measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency"	 leaf area index	 greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least five spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to field metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11 days for all species and elevation combinations	 but improved to 9 days for hardwood dominated plots and 7 days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8 days when forest type (mixed	 conifer hardwood) was used to refine predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low	 inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology overtime. This was confirmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12 days of mean absolute error. However	 image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.							
AB We investigated the heat resistance of a four-strain mixture of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef in both the absence and presence of white and green tea powders and an apple skin extract. Inoculated meat was cooked using the sous-vide technique	 i.e.	 the meat was packaged in sterile bags and completely immersed in a circulating water bath at low temperature for a period of time. The bags were cooked for I It to an internal temperature of 55	 58	 60	 or 62.5 degrees C	 and then held from 240 min at 55 degrees C to 10 min at 62.5 degrees C. The surviving bacteria were enumerated by spiral plating onto tryptic soy agar overlaid with sorbitol-MacConkey agar. Inactivation kinetics of the pathogens deviated from first-order kinetics. D-values (time	 in minutes	 required for the bacteria to decrease by 90%) in the control beef ranged from 67.79 min at 55 degrees C to 2.01 min at 62.5 degrees C. D-values determined by a logistic model ranged from 36.22(D(1)	 the D-value of a major population of surviving cells) and 112.79 (D(2)	 the D-value of a minor subpopulation) at 55 degrees C to 1.39 (D(1)) and 3.00 (D(2)) at 62.5 degrees C. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in the sensitivity of the bacteria to heat was observed with the addition of 3% added antimicrobials. D-value reductions of 62 to 74% were observed with apple powder and 18 to 58% with tea powders. Thermal death times from this study will assist the retail food industry to design cooking regimes that ensure the safety of beef contaminated with E. coli O157:H7.						
AB The disparities in colon cancer incidence between African-Americans and other U.S. ethnic groups are largely unexplained. This report examines associations of various food groups with colon cancer in African-Americans and Caucasians from a case-control study. Incident cases of histologically confirmed colon cancer	 age 40-80 years	 (n = 613) and matched controls (n = 996) were interviewed in-person to ascertain potential colon cancer risk factors. Diet over the year before diagnosis or interview date was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire adapted to include regional foods. Multivariate logistic regression models estimated energy-adjusted and non-energy adjusted odds ratios (OR). Controls generally reported higher consumption (daily amount and weekly frequency) of fruits	 vegetables and dark green	 deep yellow fruits/vegetables	 whereas cases consumed more refined carbohydrates and fats	 oils and snacks. Regardless of ethnic group or energy adjustment	 high and frequent vegetable consumption (particularly dark green vegetables) was protective	 consistent with 20-50% reductions in risk. In Caucasians	 high refined carbohydrate and red meat consumption (amount and frequency) was associated with a statistically significant 2-fold increased risk in non-energy adjusted models. In African-Americans	 frequent intake of dairy foods was associated with a doubling in risk (OR = 1.9	 95% CI = 1.1-3.4) in non-energy-adjusted models	 whereas frequent fruit consumption correlated with a nonsignificant 30% lower risk. These findings add to growing evidence that plant foods may protect against colon cancer; however	 the effects of the other food groups varied by ethnic group and energy adjustment. These results may also explain some of the ethnic differences in colon cancer incidence. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss	 Inc.		
AB Aims: To modify a strain of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium to express unique marker traits and then define how the concentration of the marker in bovine faeces affects the probability of its detection by culture preceded by immunomagnetic separation (IMS).																
AB Background: Lifestyle factors	 including food and nutrition	 physical activity	 body composition and reproductive factors	 and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with breast cancer risk	 but few studies of these factors have been performed in the Japanese population. Thus	 the goals of this study were to validate the association between reported SNPs and breast cancer risk in the Japanese population and to evaluate the effects of SNP genotypes and lifestyle factors on breast cancer risk.										
AB Modeling human-environment systems presents many challenges	 including incorporating structure and agency and addressing uncertainty in system components and relationships. Exploring perceptions not only gives us insight into decision-making (agency) but also reveals structural constraints influencing those decisions (including perceived constraints). This study focuses on the human-nature dynamics of Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China	 a biodiversity hotspot and the only habitat for the Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi). The monkey is endangered and increasingly threatened by growing human activity and development but is also affected by changing habitat through reforestation programs. This research aims to understand how human demographics	 a recent reforestation program (Grain-to-Green)	 land use	 livelihood	 and perception of conservation may affect local people's perception of human impact on the environment. This perception underlies many land use decisions yet is not uniformly shared among FNNR inhabitants. Using logistic regression	 the data from a 263-household survey conducted in the spring of 2010 were analyzed. The results indicate the Grain-to-Green Program participation is insignificantly related to perception of human environmental impact. However	 personal observation of the golden monkey is vital to locals reporting an enhanced appreciation for potential human environmental impacts. Other significant factors predicting sensitivity to human environmental impacts include having heard of climate change	 interest in tourism entrepreneurship	 current worries of food security	 viewing FNNR regulations as restrictive	 income source	 and fuelwood consumption. Results suggest the importance of examining environmental perception for a more integrated understanding of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.			
AB Objective. Insulin resistance (IR) is regarded as one of the earliest features of many metabolic diseases	 and major efforts are aimed at improving insulin function to confront this issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of body mass index (BMI)	 cigarette smoking	 alcohol intake	 physical activity	 green tea and coffee consumption to IR. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 1542 male self defense officials. IR was defined as the highest quartile of the fasting plasma insulin (>= 50 pmol/L) or the homeostasis model assessment-estimated IR (HOMA-IR >= 1.81). An unconditional logistic model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between IR and influential factors. Stratified analysis by obesity status (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)	 non-obese; >= 25 kg/m(2)	 obese) was performed. Results. IR was significantly positively related to BMI and glucose tolerance	 negatively related to alcohol use. Independent of obesity status	 significant trends were observed between IR and alcohol use. Drinking 30 mL or more of ethanol per day reduced IR by less than 40%. Strong physical activity was associated with decreased risk of IR based on fasting plasma insulin only in the obese. Coffee consumption was inversely associated with the risk of IR based on HOMA-IR in the non-obese group. Conclusion. Higher coffee consumption may be protective against IR among only the non-obese. Further studies are warranted to examine the effect modification of the obesity status on the coffee-IR association.							
AB The age-adjusted incidence of prostate cancer is low in Japan	 and it has been suggested that the traditional Japanese diet	 which includes many soy products	 plays a preventive role against prostate cancer. We performed a case-control study on dietary factors and prostate cancer in order to assess the hypothesis that the traditional Japanese diet reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Four geographical areas (lbaraki	 Fukuoka	 Nara	 and Hokkaido) of Japan were selected for the survey. Average daily intake of food from 5 years before the diagnosis was measured by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We studied 140 cases and 140 individually age (+/-5 years)-matched hospital controls for analysis. Estimates of age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and linear trends were calculated by conditional logistic regression models with adjustment for cigarette smoking and total energy intake as confounding factors. Consumption of fish	 all soybean products	 tofu (bean curds)	 and natto (fermented soy-beans) was associated with decreased risk. ORs of the fourth vs. first quartile and 95% confidence intervals (95%Cls) were 0.45 (0.20-1.02) for fish	 0.53 (0.24-1.14) for all soybean products	 0.47 (0.20-1.08) for tofu	 and 0.25 (0.05-1.24) for natto. Consumption of fish and natto showed significantly decreasing linear trends for risk (P<0.05). Consumption of meat was significantly associated with increased risk (the OR of the second vs. first quartile was 2.19	 95%CI 1.00-4.81). Consumption of milk	 fruits	 all vegetables	 green-yellow vegetables
AB Background: Hepatic resection in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with a risk of post-operative liver failure and higher morbidity than patients without liver disease. There is no universal risk stratification scheme for CLD patients undergoing resection.
